Bugs
----
o  tin may crash when using a broken overview-file
   make read_nov_overview more stable (ignore ctrl-m's etc.)

o  if reading news from a local spool with xover support tin assumes that he
   could update the overview files - that's not always true (reading via
   NFS) - if this fails, tin creates own overview-files in ~/.tin/.news/
   DULL!!!

o  tin assumes that overview-files are named ".overview" - that's not always
   true -> use "overview", "ov", ... as fall-back names.

o  tins kill-file editor does not quote brackets, stars and question marks
   in the subject - this leads to unexpected results cause they are
   treated as wildcards

o  only create_index_lock_file() if it is really needed (tind/tin -U) and only
   try to remove the lock file if it is really created (cleanup_tmp_files())

o  fix article superseding that it enters the editor immediately

o  if no INEWSDIR is given INEWSDIR is set to NEWSLIBDIR which is not always
   true (Linux) ... search $NEWSLIBDIR, /usr/bin/,... in that case.

o  if external inews could not be found posting fails but no dead.article
   is saved :(
   fall-back to build_in_inews would be good...

o  if postings fails tin rereads the article numbers for the group you
   tried to post in to sync with your new article which does not exist,
   useless!

o  mailing an article (not with an external mailer) with editing the subject
   in the editor shows you the old subject after leaving the editor :-(
   but uses the new one :)

o  Followup-To: line is not examined weather the mentioned group(s) are valid
   on this server (btw. with nntp_only & tin -n this feature is useless
   cause it may lead to wrong results (on the other hand, posting in a
   newsgroup which one isn't subscribed to is not very useful))

o  Newsgroup: and Followup-To: stripping should be done before Followup-To:
   is examined weather it contains several groups...

o  if a colored signature wraps over a page-break, the coloring gets lost

o  'D' deleted article flag (thread selection level) is not showing up.
   (is it still needed?!)

o  tin does not warn you if you try to save into a directory and not into
   a file. 

o  if save marked_hot_article fails with cannot create file the
   post-process query comes up - stupid!

o  When tagging/auto-selecting files to be saved and decoded, if a tagged
   article is expired from the server (WHY do they show up? they are
   expired...), it is untouched, and remains marked as unread.

o  Colors are not reset when tin is suspended with ^Z (signal.c)

o  According to 026) in CHANGES, some of the config files can be
   trashed on a bad write

o  full_page_scroll=OFF seems not to work

o  tin sometimes crashes (thread.c) 710/892/987

o  rereading the active file is buggy, it causes crashes on some machines and
   sometimes it takes 50 times longer than the first read at startup...

o  looks like DEFAULT_EDITOR (fall-back if neither $EDITOR nor $VISUAL is set)
   is missing for SCO

o  looks like Keywords & Summary in attributes/x_headers are ignored :(

o  when changing the window size while in options menu, the article/group/
   thread overview will be displayed (depends from where you entered the
   options menu), but you are still in the options menu. Probably, the
   routine for the signal for window resizing must be changed at the
   beginning of change_config_file() and be reset at the end of it.

New features
------------
o  add rfc1468/1922 support

o  add a weed-out list like in elm so the user could specify which headers
   he'd like to see and which not (attrib.c)

o  compile-time option: generate own MSGIDs on host with a proper FQDN
   (to add a _-_ to the local part of the MSGID on a subject-change; keep
    MSGIDs of own articles in ~/.tin/posted to be able to detect f'ups to
    own postings)

o  add
       --disable-piping               (default off)
       check for str[n]casecmp() and if necesarry define it to
       my_str[n]icmp()
   to autoconf; determine which network libraries are needed; eradicate
   platform/compiler ifdefs

o  move architecture dependent files to subdirectories, clean up architecture
   independent files, rename several defines, remove useless doubled defines

o  split tin.h/proto.h for better dependencies in make

o  join Makefile and makefile (not entirely possible)

o  unique newsgroups after editing article

o  add 'U'untag all command to thread level.

o  add feature save selected/tagged files sequentially to the same file

o  rewrite NGLIMIT handling (post.c)

o  use several functions from libcurses/<curses.h> if it's present in
   curses.c 

o  Reorganize tinrc into related sections for easier editing
   e.g., Display, Posting etc.

o  fix built-in inews to truncate signature > 4 lines
   (compile-time option?)

o  add feature Cc:

o  sender-patch
   If user ads From:-line, accept it but build a Sender:-line
   [If reverse-lookup for Sender: 'fails' put it in the 'real name' part of the
   Sender:-line nobody@akk.uni-karlsruhe.de (RFC 1413 reverse-lookup not
   verified)]
   If user ads Sender:-line rename it to X-Unverifiable-Sender and
   ad a Sender:-line
   (for canceling articles never look at the Sender:-line, always look at
   the From:-line)

o  add counter to post-processing commands (processing file x of y)

o  add feature show_new_newsgroups_since

o  add feature goto using the 'G' key
   use a general purpose routine for locating regex's in articles
   Use this to goto:
   URL's
   Message-ID's

   Could also be used to better detect (or act upon) :
   Quoted text
   uuencode header lines
   etc...

o  if Newsgroups:-line has groups in it which are not present in the users
   active file ask the user if he wants to strip these groups from the
   newsgroups-line (N/y)

o  bring up a warning on a long newsgroup/followup line (>=5 groups) and
   force the user to confirm every single group he wants to post in.
   (N/y)

o  bring up a warning when trying to f'up into a binaries group
   (Warning, sending a followup to a binaries group is undesired, post it
   anyway? N/y)

o  posting to a binaries group should warn if no followup is set to another
   group/poster (you have not set a target for a possible discussion on your
   post, would you like to go on anyway? N/y) 

o  when posting to a group which name has a uppercase-letter: bring up a
   warning: "Newsgroup-names should be all lowercase, correct it? (Y/n)"

Docs/online help
----------------
o  man page is well out of date and is buggy. Rewrite.

o  toggle behavior of 't'ag is not mentioned in the man-page

o  print a message at startup if server doesn't grok XOVER

o  error message when tin -uv and using xover is misleading

Not yet classified
------------------
o  if (show_description && !CURR_GROUP.descrition) don't truncate
   active_name (select.c)

o  move all strings to lang.c

o  looks like, that while being connected to a server, new newsgroups are
   not recognized and that tin writes a timestamp of the last time it read
   the active-file (not connection time?), so it is possible that you never
   see some new newsgroups. (not, sure about that, could have been a fault
   with the test-news-server)

o  select range and process selected range seems not to work

o  what is with DEBUG_NEWSRC_FIXME (not DEBUG_NEWSRC) in newsrc.c?

o  what is with NEW_HASH_METHOD in misc.c?

o  what is with HAVE_GENERIC_AUTHINFO in open.c?

o  what is with USE_GENAUTH in open.c?

o  what is with setup_soft_base - anyone remembering where it was used and
   the the code was not stripped after it was considered as no longer needed?

o  check all switch()s for missing defaults (this can be done by some compilers)

o  repost ('x') ignores ~/.tin/headers & ~/.tin/attributes - bug or
   feature?!

o  kill-file may get messed up if using multiple news servers with feeds
   that are not identical (moving some groups entries under new groups and
   losing all references to the moved groups)

o  sometimes (when using tins kill-menu) kill-file entries are
   duplicated/get lost or messed up

o  killing articles with Lines: 0 does not work

o  forged canceling via Supersedes:/Also-Control:/Control:-header is possible
   if it is supplied by hand (buildin_inews)

o  f'uping with 'F' to a article which has Followup-To: poster set an then
   use 'm' quotes the text, but it should not! (mail_to_someone has no
   copy_text switch)

o  when From: only contains "First-name Last-name" tin strips the space
   misc.c:parse_from() ??

o  if exiting tin with
   catchup_read_groups=ON
   thread_articles=ON
   tin first threads the group and than catches
   it up and than exits - but threading is not necessary for a catch-up!
   and it does a filter before exiting - stupid!

o  when last articles in a newsgroup were canceled, it shows that there are
   new articles in that group, even if entered that group in a session before

o  article save with auto_save=ON & Archive-name: doesn't not work correctly

o  shows up cross-postings multiple times even if read once before getting
   a resync/reread active/newsrc-file

o  strange behavior when starting up tin with one newsgroup in the
   command-line: tin checks for new-groups (useful?) 
   if there are any it ask you whether you like to subscribe or not
   (useful?) and enters the group (ok) but
   does not react on (r) toggle display to show all/unread subscribed-to
   groups - but brings up a "Matching 'group-name' groups..." and does not
   redraw the screen.
   (y)ank in/out unsubscribed groups from .newsrc seems to work fine but a
   (r) after yanking all groups ends up in "Matching 'group-name' groups..."
   and showing only the group specified in the command-line - the
   show_all_groups status gets lost, so that a second (y) leads to
   show_all_subscribed groups, while (r) still won't work. without (r) (y)
   toggles normal.
   also tin automatically subscribes you to the newsgroup specified in the
   command-line instead of just showing them to you.
   if tin does not find the group specified in the command line it behaves
   normal

o  if answering (c)atchup with (n) you are leaving the group... not useful

o  numbering of Hot articles is wrong after (post)processing them
   (6T 0A 0K -5H R)

o  (Y)ank in after resync-time ends up in a double re-read of the active file

o  with show_only_unread_groups=ON and (y)ank in all groups, (y)ank out all
   groups show_only_unread_groups-status get lost :(

o  (g)oto group (and (S)ubscribe pattern) is case sensitive
   also newsgroup names in the command-line are case sensitive
   better would be: check if they exist and if not ask if you would like to
   convert newsgroup name to lowercase
	[son_of_1036]
	NOTE: Possibly newsgroup names  should  have  been
	case-insensitive, but all existing software treats
	them as case-sensitive.   (RFC  977  [rrr]  claims
	that they are case-insensitive in NNTP, but exist-
	ing implementations are believed to ignore  this.)
	The simplest solution is just to ban use of upper-
	case letters, since no widespread  newsgroup  name
	uses  them  anyway; this avoids any possibility of
	confusion.

o  fix reposition of cursor after reading active file... annoying! 

o  think about group numbering in "only unread" display mode

o  'g'oto group does not work when starting up tin with:
   show_only_unread_groups=ON
   show_only_unread=ON
   but having no articles to read

o  fix kill/hot mechanism that you could kill/mark hot everything which
   contains abc OR def... like "tin *|* tin|* tin *" -even better would be
   a routine which recognizes word-delimiters so that "tin:" or "'tin'"
   would be also matched in an expression like "^tin^" and which would not
   match "posting"

o  fix kill/hot mechanism so that it is possible do kill massive-cross-posts
   (Velveeta-kill)

o  fix kill/hot mechanism so that it is possible do kill articles with
   "X-*" headers (X-Mailer: Bazilla 47.11 etc.)

o  add kill mechanism on Newsgroups:-line (f.e.: in junk I only want to see
   all those articles which are not! posted to junk)
   group=junk
   type=0
   newsgroups=junk

o  fix sending out a 'group' for each newsgroup on 'Y' when connected to a
   cnews-server

o  mailers other than sendmail (f.e. elm) and use_mailreader_i=OFF may lead
   to 'duplicated'-headers and multiple signatures

o  mail_bugreport() with other mailers than sendmail and use_mailreader_i=ON
   ignores start_line_offset

o  marking latest article with 'K' does not jump to top of newsgroup if
   there are still articles to read (group.c:740)
