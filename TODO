o  Do a listgroup and mark regions as setup_base is read and then do a
   find first unread in bitmap and then do read_nov_file()

o  FIX newsgroup as cmdline parameter. Its ignored and does all.

o  Add code to also say NO ARTICLES if count == 0 ie. comp.xemacs 1-60 no arts

o  also check if CR and TAB to group work for quit

o  'w' 'f' post should be settable to email address for mail groups

   - Update man page to include group scoping description
   Why is X_undo: goto belong to '+' and not X command?

o  -R recursive group create paths in tind or just mkdir -p in  start () == -1

ADD
---
o Add S save command (1 key) to save using preset defaults

o  kill/select filter routines.
   Add BODY selection to free text entry (WARN how slow it'll be)
   Add "cmd for scoring

o When headers then switch into iso2asc mode automatcally
  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

o  Add auto-aliasing of peoples mail addresses to mail aliases file
   ie. use .mailrc.

o  HiLite group.c 1587 art_marked_selected || art_marked_inrange

o  Add '=' modified to handle select articles on datetime maybe use
   9412311200 or just 1200 for all articles that are newer than today at
   noon. Also store string to tinrc. If not any string give 0000 for 
   all arts news since midnight.

o  Add # for range commands (c K z [ ] Quick-filter feed.c commands etc.)
   Mark all elements in array that match with a '#' before command is
   done. Have a vDelRange() at top of loop if any range active if() etc.
   Document help screens.

o  Add LIST MOTD support (Rich Salz)

o  Test psFindGrp ()
o  Add psAddGrpMyGrp() to partner iFindGroupIndex() etc.
o  Add psArtFirst() Next() etc. to list.c

o  For tind just add all the groups in active[] to my_group[] and not newsrc.c
   or active file.

o  FIX -R option to use ~/.tin/active.save ~/.tin/.save 
   also change to use ~/.tin/.mail & ~/.tin/.news for index dirs
   Have NEWS  MAIL  SAVE (-R) type groups
o  Fix -S option to create an active file when new articles are
   saved to <savedir>. Also fix -R option to read ACTIVE file created
   by -S command. Use actived in -R cmd line option.
   Use an active.news file in ~/.tin. Auto check at startup time

o  Allow compression to be used on local nov index files to help offset the
   increase in size. Allow user specified compresser to be used gzip lha etc

o  MAYBE also check if min / max article was deleted.  If so then update
   the active[] entry for the group and rewrite the mail.active file

o  Rewrite toggle_my_group() to not use newsrc file directly

o  In attributes make Maildir & Savedir the same and save directly to 
   groups maildir after checking new max artnum.

o  Change 'w' command in MAIL group to mail a msg not post it.
   Use logic code for mailing lists.

o  Add DETAILED bug report msg to tin_done(1) and use it in signal_handler()
  
o  Look at the list of commands that don't work(?) + . * etc. (Mike Holmes)

o  PROBLEM!  bitmap is set initially to all arts unread and seq
   is parsed to mark arts as read.  Problem is that expired arts
   are never marked unread so num_unread arts is in error.

o  Test D elete command at page level for mailgroup articles.
   Fix Delete_article() to get sitename/mailname before uname().
   Check if using external inews. If so then use sitename file before
   any NNTP_* define values.
   If MAIL grp then write list of fullpaths to .tin/.delete.mail
   and delete the list when exiting tin so that undelete exists ala elm.
   Also mark screen so that Article is shown as 'D' deleted instead of '+'

o  In Xref: optimize art_mark_xref() do that article in present group is
   not marked read ?

o  Make a procmail filter to auto create ~/Mail/mail/$USER so that when
   procmail filter is installed you see group mail.iain in groups screen

o  Add code to sub/unsub & get num_unread arts after add_my_group() called.

o  Add TIN_INEWSDIR shell var to inews.c

o  Add strfline() routine for user specified format in screen layouts.
   Can be used later for making mailgroups look like elm.
   Add Lines: to 'U'nthread mode at group index (subjects) level.

o  Add -C cmd line switch to update newsrc but not index files.

o  In positioning of groups don't do all the BS in newsrc.c. Just change 
   (ie. swap) the 2 values in my_group[] and do a write_newsrc().

o  TEST code to enter group if only one group is matched on cmd line.
    ie.,  tin alt.sources

o  Fix bug in -cv that causes my_group[cur_groupnum] to point at
   the wrong group because cur_groupnum is never incremented.

o  Add t_time & t_hash typedefs for 32/64 bit machines.

o  Fix read_xover_file() to read from socket and not from file.

o  Add following default headers to ~/.tin/tinrc & ~/.tin/attributes:
     Reply-To:		mailgroups
     Organisation:
     Distribution:
     Cc:            mailgroups
   Also add as group attributes so single groups can have different headers. 
   IMPORTANT for full benefits in mailgroups.

o  Add global attributes file for site. LIST ATTRIBUTES / LIBDIR/attributes

o  Fix pattern/hot save so that archive-name is not used but explicit 
   entered path (Hakan).

o  Fix mailing so that if editor is never entered the screen will not be 
   redrawn.

o  Fix thread & hot saves so that arts are in correct order.

o  Fix 'z' command mark all unread when in R mode at group select level.
   It is not recognizing current group but group when all groups are been
   read. Is my_group[] or index_point been used as index?

o  Add ROT13 as option on cmd line post menu. Encode from End of Header
   to -- before sig. Put [Rot13 encoded text follows] as note for reader.

o  Fix 'm' mail thread and then q)uit still mails the thread.

o  Fix 'm'ove group when all groups are shown (R off).

o  Fix -R (read saved news) to use mail_active code to save to active.save
   mail should use active.mail.
   All other groups should be not allowed to be read. 
   The saved groups are written to active.save if attr.batch_save=ON
   What should happen if -f Newsrc-file is specified on command line?
   When 'tin -R' is used don't reread the active file ever.

o  Fix 'm' 'g' & 'R' is in force and group has no unread reset 'R' mode 
   to show all and then goto it.

o  smtp_open() smtp_close() in smtplib.[ch] (plus #defines for SMTP responses.
   burp_open() burp_close() in burplib.[ch] (plus #defines for BURP responses.
   All will use the nntplib C routines from nntplib.c 

o  Fix(?) after save the '+' is not updated as art read.

o  If -f .newsrc -S/-M specified then don't use attribute.batch_save to
   determine if group should be saved just save the groups that are
   specified in -f .newsrc-file. 

o  Fix threading arts so global can be set but local (group level) can
   override it. At moment once set global unthreaded cannot toggle
   threading within group.

o  Fix set show only unread in 'M' menu at article viewer level that causes
   'cannot find basenote articles' (Thomas Omerzu).
   Save respnum before so that it can be found after with which_thread() ?

o  Change write_attributes_file () to write active attributes that are 
   different than global settings. Also a menu 'M' interface to set all 
   the options PL8.

o  Add options to 'M' menu to allow setting all the variables that are now in 
   the tinrc file.

o  Fix Save in feed.c routines. 
   Also fix so SAVING routines just use save_art_to_file() and print
   *** X Articles saved *** & none of the BS done at the moment

FIX FEATURES V2.0
-----------------

o  If saving in mailbox format and mailbox does not exist query the user?

o  Add Ctrl-/ Ctrl-? to search the whole of an article (Subj,From & Body)
   at Group & Page level. Also add Ctrl-/ to group selection level so that all
   groups/wildcard pattern are searched from top level. Inform user via
   'Searching alt.sources 100...'   'Searching alt.sources 150...'

o  Add ^G command to skip to next Subject: in digests.

o  Try compiling with -D_POSIX_SOURCE

ADD FEATURES
------------

o  Add -P <pattern> or -P <file> to search for in new news and to
   notify user by mail. Should understand 'subject=text' 'from=text'
   'body=text' and .AND. && .OR. || for filtering purposes.

o  Sort .newsrc according to preference. 

o  Sort active file as it is read.

o  Add support for nc newsclip support from clarinet .

o  Add threading on References like gnus.

o  Add full curses support..

o  Sub all not empty groups by looking at min max values in active array
   and Unsub all empty groups by looking at min max values in active 
   array. have a command to do this in a toggle effect.

o  Add clumping (Andreas Klemm) to have [scsi] as subject with all arts
   that have scsi in header under this pseudo subject. useful in *linux*

o  Each group could have a field to say which NNTP/local connection to use so
   as to be able to plug into different NNTP servers for different newsgroups

o Add t_virtual struct for virtgroups.
  Read in before active file - read_virtgrp_file()
  +  add group to virtual group and write to ~/.tin/virtual
     if not at virt then prompt for name:
