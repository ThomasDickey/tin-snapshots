News machine names
------------------

--with-mail-gateway
Defines the name of your news gateway machine. Useful if you don't want 
your internal network visible to the outside world, or if your inews script
or NNTP server rewrites your address for you.
If the first letter of the string is a '/' the gateway name will be read from 
the specified file.
If the first letter of the string is a '$' the gateway name will be read from 
the specified environment variable. The env. variable contents may be a path.
If the first letter of the string is a '%' the gateway name will be directly
appended to the user-name.  
The '%' hack will *only* be used if INEWS_MAIL_DOMAIN is not defined.
Note: don't define if INEWS_MAIL_DOMAIN is defined.

Example 1: If you are on machine 'tragic' at network domain 'confusion.com', 
Tin will assume your From: line should read "user@tragic.confusion.com".  If
your inews script instead rewrites your address as "user@confusion.com", you 
will be unable to cancel your own postings.  To make your posts and cancels 
work properly, define -DINEWS_MAIL_GATEWAY=\"confusion.com\"
Example 2: I use this define to make all my net postings appear from our news
gateway machine 'anl433' even though I post from my own workstation 'sony01'
i.e. -DINEWS_MAIL_GATEWAY=\"anl433\"
Example 3: -DINEWS_MAIL_GATEWAY=\"%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net\" (using the 
'%' hack) will create the net address "Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net"

--with-mail-domain
Defines the name of your network domain. 
If the first letter of the string is '/' the domain name will be read from 
the specified file.
If the first letter of the string is a '$' the domain name will be read from 
the specified environment variable. The env. variable contents may be a path.
Note: don't define if INEWS_MAIL_GATEWAY is defined.

Example 1: I use this define to add our uucp domain '.uucp' to our news 
gateways machine address 'anl433.uucp'. Note the leading dot '.' which
is *always* needed before the domain name. 
i.e. -DINEWS_MAIL_DOMAIN=\".uucp\"


General Notes on Building Tin
-----------------------------

Tin has been compiled on a wide range of Un*x machines with cc and gcc.
A list of these machines can be found at the end of this file.

This file is long (so was the yellow brick road) but please read it all
as it could save you problems later and we don't want an unhappy ending
do we? :-)  

Tin can be compiled to read news in any of the following ways:

  o  locally from your machines news spool dir (default /usr/spool/news).

  o  locally and remotely (rtin or tin -r option) (--enable-nntp).

  o  remotely from another machine via NNTP but creating tin index files
     on local machine for each user in $HOME/.tin/.index 
     (--enable-nntp-only).

  o  remotely from another machine via NNTP and also retrieving tin index
     files from remote machine via NNTP (--enable-nntp-only). This
     option requires that my NNTP patch be applied to your NNTP 1.5.11t5 
     server nntpd. On the NNTP server the index daemon of tin
     'tind' needs to be run from cron to update the index files at regular 
     intervals (not required if INN/Cnews generate NOV index files).

  o  remotely from another machine via NNTP and retrieving NOV style index
     files from remote machine via the NNTP XOVER extension 
     (--enable-nntp-only). 

Many machines require the name of the news gateway machine or the news
domain to be set via the --with-mail-gateway or the --with-mail-domain
configure options.  This is true of both NNTP and local news systems.


Building Tin (Normal & Daemon versions) 
---------------------------------------

Normal version

1)  Type './configure --help' to see which options are needed for your
    local setup.
2)  Change conf-tin for you needs or run ./configure with all needed
    options.
3)  Goto src subdirectory and type 'make' to compile for your system.
4)  Type 'make install' to install.

Index daemon version

Note1: If you want to retrieve tin index files from your NNTP server,
      or if you don't run NNTP but want to install tin setuid and have
      a central index rather than each user keeping his/her own index
      and want tind to automatically keep the index up-to-date, then
      you will need the tind index file daemon; create it using the
      following steps:

  1)  Build and install the 'Normal version' of tin as specified by the
      above 4 points.
  2)  Run "make clean" to delete the *.o files from the normal version.
  3)  The tind index daemon needs to be installed on your NNTP server,
      or on your stand-alone news server if you're not using NNTP.
      More info. concerning my NNTP patches & the tin daemon can be
      found in the INSTALL.NNTP file.  If you don't use NNTP, just
      install tind on the machine that has the news spool directory.
  4)  Apply my NNTP patches to your nntpd server or this will not work 
      with NNTP!!!. (If you want tind locally read Note3).
  5)  Edit the Makefile and add -DINDEX_DAEMON to your COPTS entry and
      remove any -DNNTP_* defines. Also remove -lcurses, -ltermcap, and
      any other screen-handling libraries used, as tind does not need to
      be linked with curses and it will save a good 30-50K on the size of
      tind.
  6)  Type 'make <system type>' to compile tind daemon for your NNTP server
      or stand-alone news server.  This creates tind as the file "tin".
  7)  Rename the file "tin" to "tind" (i.e. mv tin tind).
  8)  Type 'make install_daemon' to install tind daemon on your NNTP server
      or stand-alone news server.
  9)  Add the following line to your system cron to run tind every 30 mins:
        00,30 * * * * su news -c '/usr/lib/news/tind'

  Note2: tind must be run as user 'news' and the normal tin must have
         the correct permissions to read the central index files!
  Note3: tind can also be used to update a copy of all index files

Testing Tin
-----------

Of course you _were_ going to test it before installing it for anyone else
to use, weren't you?  This is just a little reminder and some suggestions 
on what to test first, and where to look first if it's broken.

Things to test:

1) Check that you can read news from several local and world-wide groups.
   If this fails, check that the NNTP define directives are correctly set, 
   and for local news systems, that the News directory structure define 
   directives are correctly set.  For NNTP versions, check that the server is
   actually running and can be connected to from your machine.  This should 
   help you find and fix some of the most common problems.

   If reading news works fine, then:

2) Check that you can post a test message to a local distribution group, 
   preferably a test-only group.  (Remember, the world does not care to 
   know whether you are testing Tin.)  If it fails, check that the 
   INEWSDIR define is correctly set, that NNTP_INEWS is correctly set, and 
   that the News machine name define directives are correctly set.  If 
   possible, check whether you can post via some other mechanism, such as 
   Pnews.  This should help you isolate and fix the most common problems.

   If posting news works fine, then:

3) Check that you can cancel one of your test postings.  If not, it is 
   almost certain that your News machine defines need to be set correctly, 
   because Tin thinks your From: line is different from what has actually
   been posted.  See the section on News machine names below.

Further testing is desirable, but left to your individual conscience and
ingenuity.

configure options (beginning with '--') 
and compiler flags (-D<name> define directives) 
-----------------------------------------------

News directory structure
------------------------

--with-libdir=PATH
Define if news software is not in /usr/lib/news.
(only needed if not running --enable-nntp-only)

--with-spooldir=PATH
Define if news articles are not in /usr/spool/news.
(only needed if not running --enable-nntp-only)

--with-nov-dir=PATH
Define if news overview (NOV) files are not stored in SPOOLDIR.
(only needed if not running --enable-nntp-only)

--with-inews-dir=PATH
Define if bnews/cnews program 'inews' is not in NEWSLIBDIR.

NNTP - Reading & posting news
----------------------------- 

--enable-nntp (default: on)
Define if you wish to read news locally and remotely via an NNTP server.

--enable-nntp-only (default: off)
Define if you [want to | can] ONLY read news remotely via an NNTP server.

--with-nntp-default-server (default: news.$INEWS_DOMAIN)
Defines the name of the default NNTP server that tin should connect to.
Overrides the value of NNTP_SERVER_FILE. Can be overridden by setting the
environment variable NNTPSERVER.

--enable-ref-threading (default: on)
Define if you want to be able to create threads based on the
References: news header.

NNTP_INEWS
Define if you want to use my built-in NNTP POST routine so that you no
longer have to rely on the mini-inews from NNTP to be installed on each
client machine. Also check that INEWS_MAIL_GATEWAY & INEWS_MAIL_DOMAIN 
are correctly set to produce a correct From: headers for your site.
If defined then the ~/.tin/tinrc variable "use_builtin_inews" default will
be set to OFF rather than ON. The tinrc file is created automatically for
each user the first time they use tin.

NNTP_SERVER_FILE
Only define if your NNTP-server file is other than /etc/nntpserver.

NETLIBS
Contains the networking libraries needed to link with nntplib.o file.

HAVE_TIN_NNTP_EXTS
Define if you have a NNTP server that supports my XMOTD & XUSER patches.

Daemon options
--------------

INDEX_DAEMON
Define to make an index file updating daemon version of tin. Note that
no -lcurses or screen libraries need to be linked with tin when this
#define is specified. If defined this will automatically undefine all
NNTP_* defines as the daemon has to be installed on the NNTP server.


Miscellaneous options
---------------------

--enable-debug
Define if you want tin to log debug info. to files in /tmp. Activated
by tin -Dn where n is 1 for NNTP only debug logging and n is 2 for 
logging all debug info. Debug files written to /tmp are ARTS, ACTIVE,
BASE and NNTP.

--enable-forgery
Define if you want to be able to cancel postings you did not write
yourself.  The !cyberspam and cancel conventions are supported.  Be
careful with this feature, it should not be used in an free accessible
tin.  This feature does not work with INN using the INN-inews (when
using without NNTP), because INN-inews rejects these cancels.
This also allows the user to set his mail address in tinrc.

--enable-color
Define if you want to have ANSI-color support.  This works on most
color displays and the color xterm.  The color mode can be switched
on/off in ~/.tin/tinrc (use_color) and can be toggled with option -a
or key '&'.

--with-ispell=PATH
Define if you have ispell (interactive spell-checker) installed and want the
option of checking your articles, mails before posting/mailing them.
If found in search path, this is used automatically.

--with-metamail=PATH
Define if you want metamail display your MIME messages.
If found in search path, this is used automatically.

--enable-mh-mail-handling
Define if you want to use the MH style mail handling & reading code in mail.c
It should be noted that mail handling is not well tested and not yet fully
implemented. You can expect errors if you use this define so let me know the
problems by sending me a bug report ('R' bug command from within tin).

--with-pgp=PATH
Define if you have PGP (Pretty Good Privacy encryption system)
installed and want the option of checking signatures, extract keys,
sign messages and add public key to messages.  This is bound to the
key 'g' or '^G'.
If found in search path, this is used automatically.

--with-inn-nntplib=PATH
Define if you want to use the INN library functions GetConfigValue()
& GetFQDN().  The INN_NNTPLIB variable in the Makefile must contain
the correct path to INN library.

--with-iso-to-ascii
Define if you want tin to do ISO-8859-1 Charset to ASCII conversations
by default for all groups. You must specify a value of "0-6" to get tin
to use one of the 7 conversion tables for different languages.
i.e., Adding -DUSE_ISO2ASC=\"2\" to the COPTS line in the Makefile would 
be useful in the german language newsgroups. For more detailed info
read the file ./doc/iso2asc.txt. Default value for USE_ISO2ASC is "-1".

--with-ncurses
Define this if you want to link with ncurses instead of termcap.

--enable-etiquette (default: on)
If enabled, prints netiquette before posting.

--enable-locale (default: on)
If enabled, tin uses multi language support, as described in
locale(7).  If you don't have locale support installed on your system,
try --disable-locale, otherwise you won't see any 8-bit-characters.

DONT_HAVE_PIPING
Define if your system does not support piping of articles to shell commands.

DONT_REREAD_ACTIVE_FILE
Define if you do not want the active file to be reread periodically.
The reread period can be set in seconds by setting the tinrc variable
'reread_active_file_secs='

HAVE_FASCIST_NEWSADMIN
Define if you want users articles to be posted to groups that your site 
receives.  This will change the warning that a group that the user is 
posting to was not found in the sites active file to an error in the 
article checking routine therefore causing the user to remove the group
from his/her posting or to abort the posting of the article.

HAVE_MMDF_MAILER
Define if your machine uses a MMDF type mailer instead of sendmail.
It is defined as default on SCO Unix machines. It can be dynamically 
changed by setting the tinrc variable save_to_mmdf_mailbox to ON. 

NO_POSTING
Do not allow posting/followup of articles.

NO_REGEX
Define if you do not want to use regular expression pattern matching.

NO_SHELL_ESCAPE
Do not allow shell escapes.

USE_INVERSE_HACK
Define if you want inverse video and highlighted bar disabled. Can be 
toggled in tin by the 'I' command and highlight bar by 'M' command.

SMALL_MEMORY_MACHINE
Define if you are running a machine with little memory (<4MB). Tin will
run slightly slower but be more efficient in how memory is allocated and
reclaimed.
