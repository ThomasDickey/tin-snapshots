     Compile Tin For Windows
     -----------------------

     - what is it?
       - A Usenet newsreader

     - system
       - Windows 95, should work on NT, too

     - Cygwin (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/)
       - for B20

     - preliminaries
       - install ncurses first
         - get tin source (e.g. from ftp://ftp.tin.org/tin/)

     - configure
       - export CC=gcc
       - export CFLAGS="-DLOCAL_CHARSET=850"  (or 437 depends on "mode con")
       - ./configure --with-ncurses --libdir=/usr/local/lib --disable-locale

     - make
       - cd src
       - make

     - make install
       - does not work. Just copy tin.exe from the src dir to a directory in
         your path.
       - add to your profile:
              export NNTPSERVER=your.nntp.server
              export TERM=pcansi

     - notes
       - You also need an editor. vim works fine.
       - tin needs an /etc/passwd
              username:x:500:100:Real Name:/home:/bin/sh.exe
       - in autoexec or in cygnus.bat
              set HOME=c:\home
              set USER=username
       - tested with
	   tin pre-1.4 release 981225 ("Volcane")
	   tin pre-1.4 release 19990517 ("Psychonaut")
