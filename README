Y2K Information

The authors of tin believes that it is Y2K-compliant, as long as the
underlying operating system and C library are. Internally, it makes some use
of binary timestamps in Unix format (number of seconds since 1-Jan-1970) and
uses C library services to convert these to printing forms. Some
NNTP-commands still use two-digit year-portions, tin tries it's best to
convert them to a useful four-digit year format wherever needed and
possible.

It should be noted that tin does not come with any form of warranty. If you
need a full Y2K audit performing, then the source is available for this to
be done.
