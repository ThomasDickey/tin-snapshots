#
# This should become a replacement of metamail, using the mail reader
# mutt. The options of metamail are not yet implemented, but it should
# work as a filter without any problems.
# 
# This script was written to use it in combination with the tin news
# reader, where you have to set the envionment variable
# METAMAIL=metamutt, but it should work with other programs, too.
#
# You need formail (from the procmail package) to use this script. If
# you don't want to install formail, you will find an alternative
# solution (commented out) below.
#
# Pressing "g" allows you to post a Followup to a newsgroup.
#
# Options:
#  -D allows splits a digest into seperate mails by using formail
#     (Feature added by Martin Ramsch <m.ramsch@computer.org>)
#
# Most recent version can be found at http://www.rhein.de/~roland/mutt/metamutt
