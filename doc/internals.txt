Hashing in tin (updated 10/02/97)
--------------

All the main arrays in tin are dynamically managed by functions in memory.c
They are preallocated to an initial size and then grown if the high
water mark is exceeded.

The main structures are:

active[]
An array of all the groups in the active file

TODO - base[] ??

group_hash[]
active[] is hashed for faster access. An entry of -1 denotes no group at
this hashnode, >= 0 denotes an index into active[]
Multiple groups on one node are chained via the .next field (another index
ptr to active[])

my_group[]
List of integer pointers into active[]
These are the groups that actually appear on the selection screen

arts[]
This is an array of the article headers for the current group. Only headers
present in the overview (NOV) database are stored.

msgids[]
Hashed array of all the individual message-ids in arts[]
All the Message-ID and Reference headers are broken down and stored here.
They are linked together by parent, sibling and child pointers

table[]
Hash of the key headers from the articles, to save space and speed up
searches and compares.



active.c:
	read_news_active_file() populates active[] using psGrpAdd()


art.c:
	Many of the overview headers are stored with hash_str()


hashstr.c:
	hash_str() Hashes text strings

	In the article header, the following text is hashed:
		From: (including full name if supplied)
		Archive-name:
		Subject:


list.c:
	init_group_hash() clears group_hash[]
	find_group_index() returns index of group in active[]
	psGrpFind() returns a pointer to a group in active[]
	psGrpAdd() adds a group into active[] and hashes it in group_hash[]
	hash_groupname() returns hash key for a group
		This is also used to hash the actual filenames written
		in ~/.tin/.news (when not using NNTP)
		There is experimental code here for a (presumably)
		improved hash function that was never completed.

main.c:
	Just the initializers for hashing


memory.c:
	Dynamic array management.
	hash_reclaim() - free up table[] which holds the
	text cache


refs.c:
	Handling for msgids[]
	When threading, each msgid in the hash has a pointer back to
	its article header in arts[] or ART_NORMAL if the article is not
	available


select.c:
	my_group_add() adds a group to my_group[]
	my_group_find() returns the index of a group in my_group[]
