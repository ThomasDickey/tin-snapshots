<h2><a name="ToC01">1 General</a></h2>

<b><a name="ToC02">What is tin and what can it do for me?</a></b>
<p>
Tin is a netnews (also referred to as Usenet or just the news) newsreader
that provides a full screen  easy to use text based interface with online 
help at all levels for the Unix, AmigaDOS, OS/2 and Win32 operating systems.
<p>
It can read news locally from your systems news spool directory as well as
from a remote news server via NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol). News
overview (NOV) index files are used if available to speedup newsreading. 
<p>
Easy to remember commands to mail, pipe, print and save as well as auto-
unpacking of multi-part shell archives and uuencoded articles.
<p>
A full screen interface to kill uninteresting and auto-select interesting
articles allows easy tailoring to your specific interests. The concept of 
group attributes is supported for even finer control of ones newsreading. 
<p>
Batch mode mailing and saving of new articles is supported (i.e., vacation).
<p>
A builtin NNTP inews client allows a single binary (i.e., no Pnews) to be
installed in a distributed environment.

<b><a name="ToC04">Where should I report a bug, problem or suggestion?</a></b>
<p>
<pre>
Email: <a href="mailto:iain@scn.de">iain@scn.de</a>
Snail: Iain Lea, Bruecken Str. 12, 90419 Nuernburg, Germany
</pre>
<p>
Please provide as much infomation as possible when sending me a report.
Of use would be the machine type and operating system, what options tin 
was compiled with and a detailed description of what you were doing 
leading upto the problem. A stacktrace from a debugger would be best.
<p>
A detailed report has got a lot better chance of being fixed than a 
message that says 'Tin crashed and told me to send you a message' (sic).
<p>
<b><a name="ToC05">What is the copyright on tin?</a></b>
<p>

<p>
You may  freely  copy or  redistribute  this software, so  long as there 
is no profit made from its use, sale trade or  reproduction. You may not 
change this copyright notice, and it must be included in any copy made.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC06">Can I resell tin?</a></b>
<p>
No (well maybe). A commercial licence will be granted if the author is
in agreement with the intended use of the commercial venture. 
Please send email or snail mail to above address to workout any details.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC07">Can I make changes to the source code?</a></b>
<p>
Yes. All changes must be submitted to the author for inclusion in the base
distribution.  The author reserves the right to include submitted changes. 
Also read the file ./doc/HACKERS that describes tin's internal structures.

<h2><a name="ToC08">2  Compilation</a></h2>

<b><a name="ToC09">Tin will not compile?</a></b>
<p>
Most problems that arise seem to center around the file ./src/curses.c
or the include files that it tries to use. Check the ./include/config.h
file for certain HAVE_XXX defines that control which include files to
include for a certain operating system. Also read the file ./INSTALL.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC10">Tin will not link?</a></b>
<p>
Most problems center around operating systems that do not have the 
network socket routines in the system library libc.a. If you look at
the ./src/Makefile you will see for some targets a commented out line
(i.e., a # at the start of the line) that will contain the text NETLIBS. 
Add this line to the make rule below the LIBS line and remove the # at 
the beginning of the moved line. Try compiling again and cross your
fingers.

<h2><a name="ToC11">3 Configuration</a></h2>

<b><a name="ToC12">My articles Email address is wrong?</a></b>
<p>
The articles email address is something like  joe@luser  instead of the
correct address  joe@luser.confusion.com  or maybe  joe@confusion.com
<p>
You should read the ./INSTALL document which documents the following two 
./src/Makefile variables INEWS_MAIL_GATEWAY and INEWS_MAIL_DOMAIN. Both
are documented in an abbreviated form below.  Note that only one of the 
two variables should be defined.
<p>
INEWS_MAIL_GATEWAY  defines the name of your news gateway machine. Useful if 
you don't want your internal network visible to the outside world, or if your
inews script or NNTP server rewrites your address for you. 
For the above example you would set  INEWS_MAIL_GATEWAY=\"confusion.com\" 
to get the address  joe@confusion.com
<p>
INEWS_MAIL_DOMAIN  defines the name of your network domain (i.e, the bit to
tag onto the end of the host and machine name). 
For the above example you would set  INEWS_MAIL_DOMAIN=\"confusion.com\" 
to get the address  joe@luser.confusion.com
<p>
If your email address ends with the string ".subdomain.domain" then your
mail/news system has not been setup correctly. Speak to your system 
administrator.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC13">I want to use an editor other than vi?</a></b>
<p>
<li>Edit the ./include/tin.h file to reflect the editor you want to use.
<li>Set the shell variable VISUAL to the editor you wish to use i.e.,:
$ setenv VISUAL emacs
or if you are not a C-shell (csh) fan and use the bourne shell (sh)
# VISUAL=emacs
<p>     
<b><a name="ToC14">I want to use my mail aliases from elm / pine?</a></b>
<p>
Edit the ~/.tin/tinrc file default mailer variable 'default_mailer_format=' 
to make use of elm/pine. To use elm (as I do) you would set the line to:
default_mailer_format=elm -s "%S" "%T" < "%F"
which would be transformed in my case to 'elm -s "subject" "iain" < .article' 
<p>
<b><a name="ToC15">When I use the pico editor the posted article is empty?</a></b>
<p>
When setting the VISUAL shell variable (see above) make sure to use  pico -t
<p>
<b><a name="ToC16">What is the filename +6 I edit when composing an article?</a></b>
<p>
<li>Set option 2 in the options menu (M command) to OFF.
<li>Edit the ~/.tin/tinrc file default editor variable 'default_editor_format=' 
to make use of your own editor. To use pico you would set the line to:
<pre>
default_editor_format=pico -t %F
</pre>
which would be transformed to 'pico -t .article'
<p>
<b><a name="ToC17">I cannot print any articles?</a></b>
<p>
<li>Check what option 18 in the options menu (M command) thinks will print
an article (usually 'lpr'). Set to the required command (I use the following 
'a2ps -nn | lpr -h').
<li>Make sure the printer that you specify is online and ready to print.
<li>Speak to your onsite printer guru.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC18">New newsgroups are not being detected?</a></b>
<p>
Make sure that the file LIBDIR/active.times exists if reading news locally.
LIBDIR will be set to the value that you specified in the ./src/Makefile
(default is /usr/lib/news). If you still have no luck or read news via 
nntp (i.e., remotely) consult your onsite news guru.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC19">There are no articles in any newsgroups?</a></b>
<p>
<li>Are you trying to read news on a local machine when the news is actually
on a remote news server. Try using 'tin -r' or compiling with -DNNTP_ONLY.
<li>Recheck your news setup (ie., Are LIBDIR and SPOOLDIR actually where you
specified them to be in the Makefile) and speak to your news guru again. 
<p>
<b><a name="ToC20">I keep seeing the message 'article XXXX unavailable'?</a></b>
<p>
<li>If running Cnews check that the upact shell script is run daily from cron.
<li>Run tin with the -P (purge index files) to update the expired articles
from all the index files in the directory ~/.tin/.news
<p>
<b><a name="ToC21">I no longer see the message 'Indexing XXXX/XXXX...' entering a group?</a></b>
<p>
Your news server is creating NOV style overview files that tin can read so
there is no need for tin to index the new articles.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC22">How can I kill/auto-select articles?</a></b>
<p>
Tin supports killing articles as well as auto-selecting articles that are
of interest to you.  To kill articles via a menu use the Ctrl-K command.
A single command quick-kill is possible using the ']' command.  Note that
the quick-kill is not as configurable as the menu based kill. Its default
kill behaviour can be set via the group attributes file (~/.tin/attributes).
To auto-select articles of interest to you via a menu use the Ctrl-A command
and to quick-select articles use the '[' command.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC23">How do I add a Distribution:, Followup-To: etc. header to an article?</a></b>
<p>
Extra headers can be added when editing your article to post. Simply add
the header (ie. Followup-To:) to the beginning of the article. Don't forget
that the keyword must be at the beginning of the line and a space must come
after the colon ':'. For example to add the Followup-To: line to an article:
<pre>
Newsgroups: comp.os.linux.misc,comp.os.research
Subject: Buffer cache idea...
Followup-To: comp.os.research

text of article
</pre>
<p>
<b><a name="ToC24">How can I post an article to multiple newsgroups?</a></b>
<p>
The 'Newsgroups' header allows an article to be posted to multiple groups.
Don't forget that the a space ' ' must come after the 'Newsgroups:' text
and that each newgroup name must be separated by a comma ',' and no space.
<pre>
Newsgroups: comp.os.linux.misc,comp.unix.misc,comp.os.mach,alt.folklore
Subject: Posting to multiple newsgroups

text of article
</pre>
<p>
<b><a name="ToC25">Can I use the SPACE key to read all my news like in rn?</a></b>
<p>
Use the TAB key to read all unread articles in all subscribed to newsgroups.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC26">What are the unrecognized nntp commands in my syslog file?</a></b>
<p>
The messages are printed in the syslog file because your nntp server does
not support some of tin's nntp extensions.  If it really bugs you and you 
don't want the extensions you can add -DDONT_HAVE_NNTP_EXTS to the COPTS 
line in the Makefile and recompile.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC27">When connecting via nntp I get the message 'nntp/tcp: Unknown service'?</a></b>
<p>
Make sure you have the following line in your /etc/services file (or the
'services' map if using NIS):
<pre>
nntp  119/tcp  usenet    # Network News Transfer                                   
</pre>
<p>
<b><a name="ToC28">How can I turn off the 3 line help mini-menu?</a></b>
<p>
The 'H' command at any level will toggle the mini-menu on and off.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC29">Can the confirmation prompts be turned off?</a></b>
<p>
Enter the options menu (M command) and select option 4 (press 4). Using
the space key toggle the ON to OFF.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC30">Can I save news for later reading while I'm on vacation?</a></b>
<p>
You can save news in batch mode from cron using a script as follows:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
tin -c -S -f newsrc-savegroups
</pre>
The -c command forces tin to mark saved articles as read in the newsrc.
The -S command forces tin to go thru all the groups in the newsrc and
save any unread articles to ~/News/group.name/number.
The -f command (optional) forces user groups to be read from specified
file instead of the default ~/.newsrc file. You should only save news
that you really do want to read later as a couple of hundred newsgroups
that you occasionaly browse will quickly fill up your disk/user quota.
Therefore create another newsrc file that contains just the groups that
you really want to save for later.
<p>
You can also mail unread news to someone by using the following command:
<p>
<pre>
tin -c -M user@somewhere -f newsrc-mailgroups
</pre>
<p>
<b><a name="ToC31">What do the T A H K R letters mean at the top of the group index screen?</a></b>
<p>
T is the number of threads in the group.<br>
A is the number of articles in the group.<br>
H is the number of hot (auto-selected) articles in the group ('*' marked).<br>
K is the number of killed in the group.<br>
R means that only unread articles will be displayed.<br>
<p>
<b><a name="ToC32">Is there any documentation available apart from the manual page?</a></b>
<p>
There is an 'Introduction to tin' document written by Paul Kramer that is
included with v1.3 PL0 onwards.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC33">Can I change the organization header for posting articles?</a></b>
<p>
To set the organization field use the shell environment variable ORGANIZATION 
(i.e., setenv ORGANIZATION text).  By using the group attributes file 
($HOME/.tin/attributes) you can setup an organziation on a per group basis.
<p>
<b><a name="ToC34">How can I see more of the newsgroups description text?</a></b>
<p>
You need to set the maximum length of the newsgroup to be displayed. This
can be accomplished by setting the groupname_max_length variable in tin's
config file $HOME/.tin/tinrc to a smaller value (i.e., 25).
<p>
<b><a name="ToC35">Why do some people claim tin doesn't thread?</a></b>
<p>
Because not everyone defines threading in the same way. Those who  assert tin 
doesn't thread consider threading to be building up a tree data structure out
of  references lines and message-ids, allowing one to deal with  followups by
subthread in logical response order and irrespective of subject changes. What
tin calls threading is actually what some other newsreaders call subject/date 
sorting. A future release of tin will support reference threading.
<p>
<h2><a name="ToC36">4 Known Bugs</a></h2>

<b><a name="ToC37">I have to press the Enter key after every command?</a></b>
<p>
You probably compiled tin on Unixware or Solaris 2.X (am I right?).
Both OS's seem to have pretty screwy terminal drivers that not setting
the terminal to raw mode. Read the INSTALL file and look at the termio
or termios code in the files ./include/config.h and ./src/curses.c
<p>
<b><a name="ToC38">thread.c (677): first_thread_on_screen != 0 </a></b>
<p>
You tried to kill or auto-select an article at the article viewer level.
It is one of the best known bugs that I have been meaning to fix for a 
long time. To fix it will require rewriting a large part of the lower
levels of tin so don't expect it anytime soon.
<p>
Note: Fixed in v1.3 PL0
