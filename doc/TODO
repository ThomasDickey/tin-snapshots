Bugs
----
o  ctrl-h doesn't turn off "Skip multipart/alternative parts"
   [Urs Janssen <urs@tin.org>]

o  external inews, ~/.signature and base64 encoding MUST 'fail'
   (article will be encoded, signature will be not!)
   [Sven Paulus <sven@karlsruhe.org>]

o  a problem concerning .tin/posted: when I post a postponed followup,
   a 'w' is written to the file instead of a 'f'. If there's a
   "References:" header, the article should be regarded as a followup.
   [Vincent Lefevre <vlefevre@ens-lyon.fr>]
   (970919 - partial solution by checking for "Re: " in subject -sp)

o  the cursor position gets 'lost' after 'y'ank in 'y'ank out - it'll
   be placed to the first(last?) group in your list, not to the one it
   pointed to before the yanks.

o  The subject lines for the 1st newsgroup in .newsrc is truncated when
   the author field is toggled off using the 'd' command.
   [Jason C Lin <jlin@hawaii.edu>]
   [I can't reproduce this - jason@radar.demon.co.uk]

o  with use_builtin_inews=ON && default_sigfile=~/.tin/sig && a existing
   ~/.signature ~/.signature is used instead of ~/.tin/sig
   (does not happen if a sigfile is specified via attributes i.e.
    scope=*.test sigfile=--none [urs])
   [Stan Brooks <stabro@almatel.net>]

o  tin (sometimes?) overwrites the newsgroup-number and number of unread
   articles with spaces when turning on newsgroup descriptions with
   strip_blanks=OFF - the bugs seems to be related to the screen-width and
   does not show up on small screens, but in large xterms...
   (sounds like a calculation error with float -> int values [urs])
   [Karsten Weiss <knweiss@trick.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de> ]

o  sometimes tin truncates newsgroup-names after turning off newsgroup
   descriptions.
   [Urs Janssen <urs@akk.uni-karlsruhe.de>]

o  commas in real-name might cause problems in mail-replys
   -> rewrite To: before mailing to old-style notation user@dom.in (real-name)

o  if you compile debug.c with -O3 on IRIX (5.3) & native-compiler tin won't
   compile at all... - use -O2 for debug.c!!

o  fix tinrc-update from old (tin1.2pl2) versions (sometime causes crashes)

o  --enable-curses has several bugs
   (screen redraw is broken, tty-settings get messed up, color might not
    work, ...)
   [seems to work properly with ncurses and SVr4 curses - need specifics
   dickey@clark.net]

o  sender-patch
   If reverse-lookup for Sender: 'fails' put it in the 'real name' part of the
   Sender:-line nobody@akk.uni-karlsruhe.de (RFC 1413 reverse-lookup not
   verified)
   If user ads Sender:-line rename it to X-Unverifiable-Sender and
   ad a Sender:-line

o  'K' is still a bit inconsistent
   - in the group and thread menu it marks current item read & jumps to the
     next unread item.
   - in the article pager (page.c) it marks the whole current thread as read
     and jumps to the next unread article.

o  'c' and 'C' are a bit inconsistent
   - 'C' (captial c) catches up the current group and enters the next group
      containing unread articles - this works at any level except the
      thread display level where only the current thread is marked read;
      no matter if using 'c' or 'C' - both do the same in the thread level.
      'C' should enter the next thread containing unread articles or skip to
      the next group, then we would need another key to catchup threads.
    - 'c' (small c) catches up the current group and skips the pointer to
      the next group - this works on any level except the pager where the
      pointer stays at the current group.

o  In cases where a tinrc variable is stored in group->attributes
   (ie on a per-group basis) then changes in the config menu won't always
   have an effect.  This is because the Option-Menu in {group,page}.c
   doesn't reread the attributes, whereas select.c does. It might be better
   to fix the problem properly in config.c by flashing changes to all
   groups using default attributes.

o  tin crashes if compiled without default-newsserver and unset $NNTPSERVER
   ???

o  reposting of a thread does not work

o  with --enable-forgery reposting of an thread reposts only the first
   article ('x' 't' 'r' <group> 'p')

o  only create_index_lock_file() if it is really needed (tind/tin -U) and only
   try to remove the lock file if it is really created (cleanup_tmp_files())

o  if no INEWSDIR is given INEWSDIR is set to NEWSLIBDIR which is not always
   true (Linux) ... search $NEWSLIBDIR, /usr/bin/,... in that case.

o  if external inews could not be found posting fails but no dead.article
   is saved :(
   fall-back to build_in_inews would be good if running NNTP_ONLY

o  if postings fails tin rereads the article numbers for the group you
   tried to post in to sync with your new article which does not exist,
   useless!

o  Followup-To: line is not examined whether the mentioned group(s) are valid
   on this server.

o  Newsgroup: and Followup-To: stripping should be done before Followup-To:
   is examined whether it contains several groups...

o  if a colored signature wraps over a page-break, the coloring gets lost

o  if save marked_hot_article fails with cannot create file the
   post-process query comes up - stupid!

o  When tagging/auto-selecting files to be saved and decoded, if a tagged
   article is expired from the server (WHY do they show up? they are
   expired! (cnews only?)), it is untouched, and remains marked as unread.

o  Colors are not reset when tin is suspended with ^Z (signal.c)
   Other tty characteristics (eg echo) are not reset after a fatal signal

o  According to 026) in CHANGES, some of the config files can be
   trashed on a bad write (except .newsrc/tinrc/attributes)

o  full_page_scroll=OFF is not implemented in page.c (article viewer)
   and config.c (option 'M'enu)

o  (Y)ank in after resync-time ends up in a double re-read of the active file

o  looks like DEFAULT_EDITOR (fall-back if neither $EDITOR nor $VISUAL is set)
   is missing for SCO

o  remove built in path of external commands (metamail, ispell, ...)

o  when enabling the 'cc/bcc on every message that is sent', and
   then mailing a message to myself, tin will print the message
   "Mailing to ... gary gary".  a nice touch would be if tin
   checks the mail_to line, and doesn't add the user's name
   twice.  yes, sendmail removes the duplicate ... but it'd
   be better if tin caught this case first.

New features
------------
o  fix check_upgrade() (config.c)
   - check if TINRC_VERSION machtes (allready done, but used string is 'wrong'
     as it's still talking about tin-unoff)
   - check if TINRC_VERSION is 'older' (missmatch and not newer) then in the
     config file, give a warings and the possibilliy to qiit without saving
     config file
   - check if TINRC_VERSION is 'newer' (allreday done) and give a warning

o  if using mailreader_i add In-Reply-To: header and rename Newsgroups:
   to X-Newsgroups (RFC 822 doesn't define a Newsgroups:-header)
   [might be impossible]

o  if using "-n" commandline switch you can't subscribe to newsgroups not
   present in your newsrc - a simple check against the server
   [i.e. GROUP $newsgroup] would help - and if the server understands
    LIST newsgroups pattern we could also fetch the description without
    loosing "-n" speed improvements]

o  word highlighting shouldn't be enabled in signatures, as '*'
   and '_' characters may be used for ASCII art (e.g. '___').
   [Vincent Lefevre <vlefevre@ens-lyon.fr>]

o  allow changing From: in mail-replys

o  item_by_item_etiquette_warnings [compile-time?]
   (i.e. enable x-posts without f'up waring, disable long-sig waring)

o  Menu/tinrc/attributes entry for TeX2ISO_Conversion=ON/OFF
   [toggle via '"']

o  Rather than cc/bcc, I'd like to see tin simply append the
   message to a mail folder, whose name is given by a setting
   in the (M)enu command, possibly overridden by the current
   setting of "record" environment variable.  The folder would
   have to be locked using a convention that will hold off
   the various Unix mailer programs.

o  have the default answer to "do you really want to send this
   bug report?" be: (y)es. check for a null body, and just ignore it ...
   [I hate all those empty bugreports ,-)]

o  add support for ispell language change

o  MIME-pgp support according to RFC2015

o  add RFC1468/1922 support

o  unique newsgroups after editing article

o  add feature save selected/tagged files sequentially to the same file

o  add feature Cc:

o  add counter to post-processing commands (processing file x of y)

o  add feature show_new_newsgroups_since

o  add feature goto using the 'G' key
   use a general purpose routine for locating regex's in articles
   Use this to goto:
   URL's
   Message-ID's

   Could also be used to better detect (or act upon) :
   Quoted text
   uuencode header lines
   etc...

o  Additions to the group menu :
        'L' (lookup message-id)

o  Additions to the thread menu :
	'/','?' (search subject)
	'B' (body search)
        'D' (cancel article)
	'M' (option menu)
	'w' (post an article)
	'r' (reply to) /* not 'R' cause it conflicts with mail_bugreport */
	''  r ought to be toggle show all/show only unread
	'f' (post a followup)
	'-' (goto last article)
	'L' (lookup message-id)
	keys to goto previous/next thread

o  Additions to the pager:
	'l' (goto thread menu)

o  Add to the 'M'enu:
        DEFAULT_MAILER

o  Add a commandline switch that prints out all values of cpp-symbols etc.

o  Reorganize tinrc into related sections for easier editing
   e.g., Display, Posting etc.

o  A system-wide tinrc configuration file, the $HOME/.tin/tinrc need only
   store the differences from this.
   A key code to reset to the system defaults
   Maybe a file which could be used to force settings (eg inews & mailer)
   (tin.defaults [--with-defaults-dir] is a start)

o  if Newsgroups:-line has groups in it which are not present in the users
   active file ask the user if he wants to strip these groups from the
   newsgroups-line (N/y)
   do the same for Followup-to:

o  bring up a warning on a long newsgroup (>=5) line and
   force the user to confirm every single group he wants to post (or
   redirect followups to) in. (N/y)
   rewrite NGLIMIT handling (post.c)
   (not just truncate Newsgroups:-line after the NGLIMITth newsgroup -
    or if we do so - give an extra warning to the user and give the the
    chance to edit the Newsgroups:-line)

o  bring up a warning when trying to f'up into a binaries group
   (Warning, sending a followup to a binaries group is undesired, post it
   anyway? N/y)

o  posting to a binaries group should warn if no followup is set to another
   group/poster (you have not set a target for a possible discussion on your
   post, would you like to go on anyway? N/y)

o  when posting to a group containing uppercase-letters: bring up a
   warning: "Newsgroup-names should be all lowercase, correct it? (Y/n)"

   (g)oto group is case sensitive
   also newsgroup names in the command-line are case sensitive
   better would be: check if they exist and if not ask if you would like to
   convert newsgroup name to lowercase
	[son_of_1036]
	NOTE: Possibly newsgroup names  should  have  been
	case-insensitive, but all existing software treats
	them as case-sensitive.   (RFC  977  [rrr]  claims
	that they are case-insensitive in NNTP, but exist-
	ing implementations are believed to ignore  this.)
	The simplest solution is just to ban use of upper-
	case letters, since no widespread  newsgroup  name
	uses  them  anyway; this avoids any possibility of
	confusion.

o  when From: only contains "First-name Last-name" tin strips the space
   misc.c:parse_from() ??

o  Bounce duplicate Message-ID's when the headers are read. This will
   make the threading code happier too.

Internal Changes
----------------
o  clean-up INDEX_DAEMON and ACTIVE_DAEMON code
   add configure option for those

o  change all system()/popen() calls to fork() and exec() calls
   [close security holes]

o  compile-time option: generate own MSGIDs on host with a proper FQDN
   (to add a _-_ to the local part of the MSGID on a subject-change; keep
    MSGIDs of own articles in ~/.tin/posted to be able to detect f'ups to
    own postings)

o  add
   to autoconf; determine which network libraries are needed; eradicate
   platform/compiler ifdefs

o  clean up architecture independent files, rename several defines,
   remove useless doubled defines

o  split tin.h/proto.h for better dependencies in make

o  check where int/long/... should be replaced by size_t/uid_t/mode_t/off_t...

o  join Makefile and makefile (not entirely possible)

o  move all strings to lang.c

o  cleanup (=rewrite) post.c/inews.c/header.c/page.c

o  is art->inthread really needed, surely art->thread contains enough
   information

o  remove annoying casts to (t_hashnode *)aptr in {art,refs}.c

o  check where tin_done() should be called instead of using exit()

o  check where STRCPY() should be used

Docs/online help
----------------
o  man page is still out dated and buggy

o  error message when tin -uv and using xover is misleading

o  tin.defaults is not mentioned in manpage/INSTALL

Not yet classified
------------------
o  tin in batchmode dumps core if getting a SIGINT, useful?

o  'u'nsubscribe/'s'ubscribe are inconsistent - bug or feature?
   's' subscribes you to the curent group and does _not_ skip to the next
       group (annoying wehen subscribing to multiple groups, but useful
       when subsribing to a single group right before reading it)
   'u' unsubsribes you form the curent goup and skips to the next group.

o  what is with the conflicting settings? should we disallow those, or leave
   it to the user to realise that i.e. strip_blanks=ON && inverse_okay=ON
   looks ugly?

o  what is tin -C (count articles)? - if running in batch-mode (-Z)
   -v gives a summary...

o  what is with DEBUG_NEWSRC_FIXME (not DEBUG_NEWSRC) in newsrc.c?

o  what is with NEW_HASH_METHOD in list.c?

o  repost ('x') ignores ~/.tin/headers & ~/.tin/attributes - bug or
   feature?!

o  forged cancelling via Supersedes:/Also-Control:/Control:-header is possible
   if it is supplied by hand (buildin_inews)

o  f'uping with 'F' to a article which has Followup-To: poster set an then
   use 'm' quotes the text, but it should not! (mail_to_someone has no
   copy_text switch)

o  f'uping with '^w' (include headers) to an article which has Followup-To:
   poster set does not include headers when using 'm' (mail to poster)

o  if exiting tin with
   catchup_read_groups=ON
   thread_articles=ON
   tin first threads the group and than catches
   it up and than exits - but threading is not necessary for a catch-up!
   and it does a filter before exiting - stupid!

o  when last articles in a newsgroup were cancelled, it shows that there are
   new articles in that group, even if entered that group in a session before

o  article save with auto_save=ON & Archive-name: doesn't not work correctly

o  shows up cross-postings multiple times even if read once before getting
   a resync/reread active/newsrc-file

o  numbering of Hot articles is wrong after (post)processing them
   (6T 0A 0K -5H R)

o  fix reposition of cursor after reading active file... annoying!

o  think about group numbering in "only unread" display mode
   (using different numbers in show all/show only unread leads to some
    problems, f.e. group moving)

o  mailers other than sendmail (f.e. elm) and use_mailreader_i=OFF may lead
   to 'duplicated'-headers and multiple signatures

o  mail_bugreport() with other mailers than sendmail and use_mailreader_i=ON
   ignores start_line_offset

Filtering enhancements
----------------------
o  add command: mark all articles older than <date> as read
   (useful when subscribing to a new group with high-traffic...)

o  fix kill/hot mechanism so that it is possible to match articles on
   arbitrary headers
