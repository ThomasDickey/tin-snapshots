READING MAIL WITH TIN
---------------------

Requirements:

Tin is able to read your mail providing it is stored in MH style folders
(ie you have a directory for each mail folder and one numbered file per
message).

You must have built tin with the --enable-mh-mail-handling configure option.

Your mail folders will be automatically merged in with your regular
newsgroups on the main screen.

Setup:

You need a mail active file. The default location of this is ~/.tin/active.mail
It contains one line per mail folder, each line has 4 fields.

  1) Mail group name.
     This must be the pathname of the mailbox relative to field #4 with
     / changed to .

  2) Max num.
     Just put a large number here, something higher than the highest
     message in the mailbox

  3) Min num.
     Put 0 here.

  4) Path of mail spool directory.
     This must be the full pathname to the root of the mail folder area.

eg:

Mail.inbox 10000 00000 /home/foo
Mail.outbox 10000 00000 /home/foo

This allows access to the 'inbox' and 'outbox' folders of user foo.
They are accessed via /home/foo/Mail/inbox and /home/foo/Mail/outbox

Usage:

Start tin as normal.
You'll have to subscribe to your mailgroups the first time you use them.
