.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tin
is a full-screen easy to use Usenet newsreader. It can read news locally (i.e.,
\fI/var/spool/news\fP) or remotely (\fBrtin\fR or \fBtin -r\fR option) via a
NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) server. It will automatically utilize
NOV (News OVerview) style index files if available locally or via the NNTP
XOVER command.
.PP
.B tin
has four separate levels of operation: Group selection level, Group
level, Thread level and Article level. Use the `h' (help) command to view a
list of the commands available at a particular level.
.PP
On startup \fBtin\fR will show a list of the newsgroups found in
\fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP. An arrow '->' or highlighted bar will point to the
first newsgroup. Move to a group by using the terminal arrow keys (terminal
dependent) or `j' and `k'. Use PgUp/PgDn (terminal dependent) or Ctrl-U and
Ctrl-D to page up/down. Enter a newsgroup by pressing <RETURN>.
.PP
The <TAB> key advances to the next newsgroup with unread articles and enters
it.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.B -a
Toggle ANSI color (default is off).
.TP
.B -c
Create/update index files for every group in \fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP or file
specified by the ``\fB-f\fR'' option and mark all articles as read.
.TP
.B -C
Count articles for each subscribed group at startup. With a large number of
groups this will be slow. However the number of unread articles in each
group will be accurate. (Not needed if also using ``\fB-n\fR'' option.)
.TP
.B -d
Don't load newsgroup descriptions (interactive mode).
.sp
Delete index files for each group before indexing article (\fBtind\fR index
daemon only).
.TP
.BI -D " debug-level"
Enter debug-level (1 = NNTP, 2 = all).
.TP
.BI -f " file"
Use the specified file of subscribed to newsgroups in place of
\fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP.
.TP
.BI -g " server"
Use the server and newsrc specified in \fI$HOME/.tin/newsrctable\fP.
.TP
.B -h
Help listing all command line options.
.TP
.B -H
Brief introduction to \fBtin\fR that is also shown the first time it is
started.
.TP
.BI -I " dir"
Directory in which to store newsgroup index files. Default is
\fI$HOME/.tin/.news\fP. This option is disabled if \fBtin\fR is compiled
as reading news via NNTP only.
.TP
.BI -m " dir"
Mailbox directory to use. Default is \fI$HOME/Mail\fP.
.TP
.BI -M " user"
Mail unread articles to specified user for later reading. For more
information read section AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS.
.TP
.B -n
Only load groups from the active file that are subscribed to in the user's
\fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP. This allows a noticeable speedup when connecting via a
slow line, but \fBtin\fR cannot tell which groups are moderated.
.TP
.B -N
Mail unread articles to yourself for later reading. For more
information read section AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS.
.TP
.B -o
Quick post all postponed articles and exit.
.TP
.BI -p " port"
Port to use if reading via NNTP (default is 119). This also overrides
the environment variable $\fBNNTPPORT\fR if set.
.TP
.B -P
Purge group index files of articles that no longer exist. Care should be
taken when using this command as it checks each and every article in each
group that is accessed. On a low speed connection this can have an
undesirable effect and it also knocks the hell out of your file-system
(\fBtind\fR index daemon only).
.TP
.B -q
Don't check for new newsgroups.
.TP
.B -Q
Quick start. Start \fBtin\fR as quickly as possible. Currently this is equivalent
to ``\fB-nqd\fR''.
.TP
.B -r
Read news remotely from the default NNTP server specified in the environment
variable $\fBNNTPSERVER\fR or contained in the file
\fI/etc/nntpserver\fP.
.TP
.B -R
Read news saved by the ``\fB-S\fR'' option.
.TP
.BI -s " dir"
Save/read articles to/in directory. Default is \fI$HOME/News\fP.
.TP
.B -S
Save unread articles for later reading by the ``\fB-R\fR'' option. For more
information read section AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS\fP.
.TP
.B -u
Create/update index files for every group in \fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP or file
specified by the ``\fB-f\fR'' option. This option is disabled if \fBtin\fR
retrieves its index files via a NNTP server.
.TP
.B -U
Start \fBtin\fR in the background to update index files while reading news
in the foreground. This option is disabled if \fBtin\fR retrieves its index
files via a NNTP server.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose mode for ``\fB-c\fR'', ``\fB-M\fR'', ``\fB-S\fR'', ``\fB-u\fR''
and ``\fB-Z\fR'' options.
.TP
.B -V
Print version and date information.
.TP
.B -w
Quick mode to post an article and then exit.
.TP
.B -X
Don't save any files (i.e. \fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP) if quitting \fBtin\fR.
.TP
.B -z
Only start \fBtin\fR if there is any new/unread news. If there is news
\fBtin\fR will position cursor at first group with unread news. Useful for
putting in login file.
.TP
.B -Z
Check if there is any new/unread news and exit with appropriate status. If
``\fB-v\fR'' option is specified the number of unread articles in each group
is printed. An exit code 0 indicates no news, 1 that an error occurred and
2 that new/unread news exists. Useful for writing scripts.
.PP
\fBtin\fR can also dynamically change its options by the `M' menu command.
Any changes are written to \fI$HOME/.tin/tinrc\fP. For more information see
section GLOBAL OPTIONS MENU AND TINRC CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES.
.PP
The index daemon version, \fBtind\fR, supports the ``\fB-d\fR'',
``\fB-f\fR'', ``\fB-h\fR'', ``\fB-I\fR'' and ``\fB-v\fR'' options.
.PP
A list of groups can be specified after the other command line options. This
can be useful if you wish to yank in or subscribe to a hand-picked subset of
the active newsgroups. The list may include the usual newsgroup wildcard
characters. It can be comma or space separated, eg:
.PP
.RS
alt.config news.*,!news.test
.RE
.PP
If you specify a single group-name, or a wildcard that matches a single
group, then you will automatically enter that group. Otherwise the normal
group selection screen will appear, but with all the matching groups present
too, as though you had yanked just those groups in.
.PP
Once you use `y' to yank in all active groups, or `r' to toggle the
read/unread status, then the command line groups will be gone. You can use
`Y' to reread the active file and get them back.
.PP
NB: With the ``\fB-n\fR'' flag, only unsubscribed groups in the
\fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP file (or the newsrc-file given by the ``\fB-f\fR''
command-line switch or via \fI$HOME/.tin/newsrctable\fP) can be matched.
.\"
.\"
.SH "NEWS ADMINISTRATION"
Maintaining Netnews on large networks of machines can be a pretty time
consuming job as I discovered when I was given the job of maintaining our
news system and news users.
.PP
A user starting \fBtin\fR for the first time can be automatically subscribed
to a list of newsgroups that are deemed appropriate by the news
administrator. The subscriptions file should be created in your news lib
directory (i.e., \fI$NEWSLIBDIR/subscriptions\fP) and should have file
permissions set to 0644. If you read news via NNTP, then your news server
must support the LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS command. It is part of the Common NNTP
Extensions and all modern servers should understand it.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SCREEN FORMAT"
\fBtin\fR has four separate levels of operation: Selection level,
Group level, Thread level and Article level.
.PP
At the Group Selection level the title displays (the name of the newsserver
and) the number of subscribed groups (containing new unread articles). The
newsgroups are displayed in the middle of the screen with the number of
unread articles displayed on the same line in front.

.PP
There may also be a character prefixing the line. An explanation follows:
.TP 10
.B u
This group is unsubscribed. To see only your subscribed groups use the `r'
or `y' toggle keys.
.TP
.B M
This is a moderated group. Any posts you make will have to be approved by the
group administrator before it will be made public. \fBtin\fR will ask for
confirmation before you post to a moderated group.
.TP
.B N
This is a new newsgroup which has been created since you last used
\fBtin\fR. New newsgroups are not subscribed to by default (However, see
the $\fBAUTOSUBSCRIBE\fR / $\fBAUTOUNSUBSCRIBE\fR environment variables). Subscribe to it
in the normal way if you wish the group to continue to appear in your
Selection Menu. Simply ignore new newsgroups and they will be gone the next
time you start \fBtin\fR. You will have to yank in all the groups to find
them in a later session.
.TP
.B D
This group no longer exists. If you no longer wish to see this group then
unsubscribe from it in the normal way. This flag will only appear if
you have set 'strip_bogus' to "ask" in the Options Menu.
.TP
.B X
You may no longer make posts to this group. Often a group will be superseded
by a more appropriately named one.
.TP
.B =
This group has been renamed and you may no longer post to it. If you do, then
you will receive an error from your newsserver telling you the correct group
to post to.
.PP
At the Group level the title contains the name of the group, the number
of conversation threads, the threading-method, the total number of articles,
the number of killed articles and the number of hot articles. i.e.,
alt.sources (5T(B) 23A 0K 0H).
It might also contain an R if your are in 'show_only_unread' mode and an M
if the group is moderated. (The later does not work with the ``\fB-n\fR''
command-line switch!).
If a thread has unread articles in it it's marked with a `+' in font of the
total number of articles in the thread.
If a thread has hot articles in it (see also section FILTERING ARTICLES)
it's marked with a `*' in font of the total number of articles in the thread.
There might also be shown the number of lines of the first (unread) article
in the thread right before the subject - this is controlled by
the 'show_lines' option.

At startup, \fBtin\fR reads in the configuration file. This contains a list
of variables that can be used to configure the way \fBtin\fR works. If it
exists, the global configuration file, \fI/usr/lib/news/tinrc\fP is read.
After that, the users own configuration file is read from
\fI$HOME/.tin/tinrc\fP. The global file is useful for distributing
system-wide defaults to new users who have no private tinrc yet.
.TP
The following variables are user configurable by editing \fI$HOME/.tin/tinrc\fP
directly. Most of them can be set in the GLOBAL OPTIONS MENU which is could
be accessed by pressing `M' at all levels. It allows the user to customize the
behavior of \fBtin\fR. The options are saved to the file \fI$HOME/.tin/tinrc\fP.
Use <SPACE> to toggle the required option and <CR> to set. Use `/', `?' to search
for a specific option. The name in braces is the name of the corresponding setting
in \fI$HOME/.tin/tinrc\fP.

If ON keep all postings in \fI$HOME/Mail/posted\fP. Default is ON.
.TP
.B Use 8bit characters in mail headers (mail_8bit_header)
Allows 8bit characters unencoded in the header of mail message. Default is
OFF. Turning it ON is effective only if \fBmail_mime_encoding\fR is also set
to 8bit. Leaving it OFF is safe for most users and compliant to Internet
Mail Standard (STD 11/RFC 822 and RFC 2047).
.TP
.B Mail address (mail_address)
User's mail address, if not username@host.
.TP
.B MIME encoding in mail messages (mail_mime_encoding)
MIME encoding of the body in mail message, if necessary (8bit, base64,
quoted-printable, 7bit) Default is 8bit and no encoding (or charset
conversion) is performed (i.e., local charset is used as it is). If set to
7bit, CJK text in 8bit encoding (EUC-CN, EUC-TW, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, Big5,
Shift_JIS) is supposed to be converted into ISO-2022-KR/JP/CN. Only EUC-KR
to ISO-2022-KR conversion has been implemented, however. Accordingly,
setting it to 7bit has no effect on MIME charsets/encodings other than
EUC-KR (Korean).
.TP
.B Quote line when mailing (mail_quote_format)
Default is "In article %M you wrote:"
.TP
.B Mark saved articles/threads as read (mark_saved_read)
If ON mark articles that are saved as read. Default is ON.
.TP
.B MM_CHARSET (mm_charset)
Charset supported locally, which is also used for MIME header (charset
parameter and charset name in header encoding)
in mail and news posting unless local charset/encoding needs to be
converted into other charset/encoding as in case of EUC-KR which
is converted to ISO-2022-KR if \fBmail_mime_encoding\fR is set to 7bit.
Possible values include ISO-8859-X (where X is 1 to 10), EUC-JP, EUC-CN,
EUC-KR, EUC-TW, Big5, Shift_JIS, and so forth.
If \fBMIME_STRICT_CHARSET\fR is defined at the compile time, text in
charset other than the value of this parameter is considered
not displayable and represented as '?'. Otherwise, all character
sets are regarded as compatible with the display. If it's not set,
the value of the environment variable $\fBMM_CHARSET\fR is used. US-ASCII
or compile-time default is used in case neither of them is defined.
.TP
.B newnews
These are internal timers used by tin to keep track of new newsgroups. Do not
change them unless you understand what they are for.
.TP
.B Display these header fields (or *) (news_headers_to_display)
Which news headers you wish to see. If you want to see _all_ the headers,
place an '*' as this value. This is the only way a wildcard can be used.
If you enter 'X-' as the value, you will see all headers beginning
with 'X-' (like X-Alan or X-Pape). You can list more than one by delimiting with
spaces. Not defining anything turns off this option.
.TP
.B Do not display these header fields (news_headers_to_not_display)
Same as \fBnews_headers_to_display\fR except it denotes the opposite.
An example of using both options might be if you thought X- headers were
A Good Thing(tm), but thought Alan and Pape were miscreants...well then you
would do something like this:
\fInews_headers_to_display=X-\fP
\fInews_headers_to_not_display=X-Alan X-Pape\fP
Not defining anything turns off this option.
.TP
.B Quote line when following up (news_quote_format)
Format of quote line when posting/following up an article (%A=Address, %D=Date,
%F=Addr+Name, %G=Groupname, %M=Message-Id, %N=Name).
Default is "%F wrote:"
.TP
.B PgDn goes to next artice at EOF (pgdn_goto_next)
If ON the PGDN or DOWN command will goto next article when pressed
at end of message
.TP
.B Goto first unread article in group (pos_first_unread)
If ON put cursor at first unread article in group otherwise at last article.
Default is ON.
.TP
.B Use 8bit characters in news headers (post_8bit_header)
Allows 8bit characters unencoded in the header of news article.
Default is OFF. Only enacted if \fBpost_mime_encoding\fR is also set to 8bit.
In a number of local hiearchies where 8bit characters are used,
using unencoded (raw) 8bit characters in header is acceptable and sometimes
even recommended so that you need to check the convention adopted in
the local hierarchy of your interest to determine what to do with this and
\fBpost_mime_encoding\fR.
.TP
.B MIME encoding in news messages (post_mime_encoding)
MIME encoding of the body in news message, if necessary. (8bit, base64,
quoted-printable, 7bit) Default is 8bit, which leads to no encoding (or
charset conversion, i.e., local charset is posted as it is). If set to 7bit,
Chinese and Japanese text (in 8bit encodings such as EUC-CN, EUC-TW, EUC-JP,
Shift_JIS, Big5) is supposed to be converted into ISO-2022-CN/JP, but it's
NOT yet implemented. Therefore, currently 7bit has NO effect (i.e.
equivalent to 8bit) whatever MIME charset/encoding is chosen.

crontab everyday while away, after which you will be mailed a report of
which articles were mailed/saved from which newsgroups and the total number
of articles mailed/saved. Articles are saved in a private news structure
under your <savedir> directory (default is \fI$HOME/News\fP). Be careful of
using this option if you read a lot of groups because you could overflow
your file system. If you only want to save a few groups it would be best to

\fBtin\fR also has the capability to generate random signatures on a per

the default signature or the group attribute sigfile as a directory.
If for example the sigfile path is \fI/usr/iain/.sigs\fP and \fI.sigs\fP is
a directory then \fBtin\fR will select a random signature from any file that
is in the directory \fI.sigs\fP (note: one signature per numbered file). A
random signature can also consist of a fixed part signature that can contain
your name, address etc. followed by the random sig. The fixed part of the
random sig is read from the file \fI$HOME/.sigfixed\fP.

If your news server supports NOV index files (most modern installations

If your news server doesn't support NOV index files, \fBtin\fR will maintain
an index for each newsgroup. There are a number of methods in which index
files can be created and updated.

The simplest method is that each user creates/updates his/her own index
files that are stored in \fI$HOME/.tin/.news\fP. This has the advantage that
any user can compile and install \fBtin\fR, but the disadvantage is that
each user is going to be creating duplicate files and using precious disk
space. A good way to keep index files updated is by doing a \fBtin -U\fR
that will update index files in the background while you are reading news in
the foreground. You can also update index files via the system batcher cron
with the ``\fB-u\fR'' option:

A slightly better method is to set \fBtin\fR setuid news and have all index
files created and updated in the news spool directory (i.e.,
\fI/var/spool/news/.news\fP). This has the advantage that there will only be
one copy of the index files on each machine on your network, but the
disadvantage is that you will have \fBtin\fR running setuid news.
.PP
A better method is to install the \fBtind\fR index file updating daemon and
have it create and update index files for all groups in your active file at
regular intervals in the news spool directory (i.e.,
\fI/var/spool/news/.news\fP). This has the advantage that there will only be
one copy of the index files on each machine on your network and
\fBtin\fR must not be setuid news, but the disadvantage is that you will
have to have news permissions to install \fBtind\fR and root permissions to
install an entry in the cron batcher system to have \fBtind\fR regularly
update index files.
.PP
The best method is to install the \fBtind\fR index file updating daemon on
your NNTP server and have it create and update index files for all groups in
your active file at regular intervals in the news spool directory (i.e.,
\fI/var/spool/news/.news\fP). This has the advantage that there will only be
one copy of the index files on the NNTP server for the whole of your
network, but the disadvantage is that you will have to install my NNTP
server patches to allow \fBtin\fR to retrieve index file from your NNTP
server and and you must install an entry in the cron batcher system to have
\fBtind\fR regularly update index files.
.PP
Entering a group the first time tends to be slow because the index file must
be built from scratch unless the \fBtind\fR update daemon is being used. To
alleviate the slowness start \fBtin\fR to create all index files for the
groups you subscribe to with \fBtin -u -v\fR and go for a coffee. Subsequent
readings of a group will cause incremental updating of the index file.
.PP
If reading news remotely and updating index files locally, operation will be
somewhat slower because the articles must be retrieved from the NNTP server.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B TINRC
Define this variable if you want to specify command line options that \fBtin\fR
should be started with to save typing them each time it is started. The
contents of the environment variable are added to the front of the command
line options before it is parsed therefore allowing an option specified on
the command line to override the same option specified in the environment.
Note that environment variables that are used to set message header lines
can also be set by adding the header name and value to the
\fI$HOME/.tin/headers\fP file.
.TP
.B TIN_HOMEDIR
Define this variable if you do not want the \fI.tin\fP directory in
\fI$HOME/.tin\fP. (i.e., if you want all \fBtin\fR's private files in \fI/tmp/.tin\fP
you would set $\fBTIN_HOMEDIR\fR to \fI/tmp\fP.
.TP
.B TIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR
Define this variable if you do not want the \fI.news\fP directory in
\fI$HOME/.tin/.news\fP. (i.e., if you want all \fBtin\fR's news index files
in \fI/tmp/.news\fP you would set $\fBTIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR\fR to \fI/tmp\fP.
.TP
.B TIN_INDEX_MAILDIR
Define this variable if you do not want the \fI.mail\fP directory in
\fI$HOME/.tin/.mail\fP. (i.e., if you want all \fBtin\fR's mail index files
in \fI/tmp/.mail\fP you would set $\fBTIN_INDEX_MAILDIR\fR to \fI/tmp\fP.
.TP
.B TIN_INDEX_SAVEDIR
Define this variable if you do not want the \fI.save\fP directory in
\fI$HOME/.tin/.save\fP. (i.e., if you want all \fBtin\fR's save index files
in \fI/tmp/.save\fP you would set $\fBTIN_INDEX_SAVEDIR\fR to \fI/tmp\fP.
.TP
.B TIN_LIBDIR
Define this variable if you want to override the \fBNEWSLIBDIR\fR path that was compiled
into the \fBtin\fR binary via the Makefile.
.TP
.B TIN_SPOOLDIR
Define this variable if you want to override the \fBSPOOLDIR\fR path that was
compiled into the \fBtin\fR binary via the Makefile.
.TP
.B TIN_NOVROOTDIR
Define this variable if you want to override the \fBNOVROOTDIR\fR path that was
compiled into the \fBtin\fR binary via the Makefile.
.TP
.B TIN_ACTIVEFILE
Define this variable if you want to override the \fBNEWSLIBDIR/active\fR path that was
compiled into the \fBtin\fR binary via the Makefile.
.TP
.B NNTPSERVER
The default NNTP server to remotely read news from. This variable only
needs to be set if the ``\fB-r\fR'' command line option is specified and
the file \fI/etc/nntpserver\fP does not exist.
.TP
.B NNTPPORT
The NNTP tcp port to read news from. This variable only
needs to be set if the the tcp port is not the default 119.
The ``\fB-p\fR'' command line option overrides $\fBNNTPPORT\fR.
.TP
.B DISTRIBUTION
Set the article header field ``Distribution:'' to the contents of the
variable instead of the system default.
.TP
.B TEX2ISO
Set the article viewer to decode German style umlaut codes to ISO latin1.
Value 0 has the same effect as not defining the variable. Use in combination
with $\fBISO2ASC\fR.
.TP
.B ISO2ASC
Set the ISO to ASCII charset decoding table character to use in decoding
an articles text. Values can range from 0 to 6.
.TP
.B ORGANIZATION
Set the article header field ``Organization:'' to the contents of the
variable instead of the system default. If reading news on an Apollo
DomainOS machine the environment variable $\fBNEWSORG\fR has to be used
instead of $\fBORGANIZATION\fR.
.TP
.B REPLYTO
Set the article header field ``Reply-To:'' to the return address specified
by the variable.
This is useful if the machine is not registered in the UUCP mail maps
or if you wish to receive replies at a different machine.
.TP
.B MAILER
This variable has precedence over the default mailer that is used in all
mailing operations within \fBtin\fR.
.TP
.B EDITOR
This variable has precedence over the default editor (i.e., \fBvi\fR(1)) that
is used in all editing operations within \fBtin\fR (i.e., posting `w',
replying `r', follow-ups `f', ...).
.TP
.B VISUAL
If $\fBEDITOR\fP is unset, then this variable is looked up for an default
editor. If $\fBEDITOR\fP and $\fBVISUAL\fR are both unset, tin will uses the
systems default editor (i.e. \fBvi\fR(1) on UNIX-systems).
.TP
.B AUTOSUBSCRIBE
\fBtin\fR interprets this variable similarly to rn. It contains a list of
patterns, separated by commas and possibly prefixed with exclamation points.
A new group is checked against the list of patterns; if it matches,
\fBtin\fR subscribes the user to the group without further query. An
exclamation point negates the meaning of a match on this pattern, and can be
used to cancel certain matches. For example, setting
.sp
\fIAUTOSUBSCRIBE=comp.os.unix.*,talk.*,!talk.politics.*\fP
.sp
will automatically subscribe the user to all new groups in the comp.os.unix
hierarchy, and all talk groups other than talk.politics groups (which will
be queried for as usual.)
.TP
.B AUTOUNSUBSCRIBE
\fBtin\fR interprets this variable similarly to rn. It is handled like the
$\fBAUTOSUBSCRIBE\fP variable, but groups matching the list are unsubscribed
from without further query. For example, setting
.sp
\fIAUTOUNSUBSCRIBE=alt.flame.*,u*,!uk.*\fP
.sp
will automatically unsubscribe the user from all new alt.flame groups
and all groups starting with u (university groups) other than UK groups (which
will be queried for as usual.)
.TP
.B SPAMTRAP
Set this variable to a list of comma-separated strings to be warned if you
are replying to an article by mail where the e-mail address contains one of
these strings. The matching is case-insensitive. Example:
.sp
\fISPAMTRAP=spam,delete,remove\fP
.TP
.B METAMAIL
Set this variable to point to \fBmetamail\fR(1) or a replacement
(i.e. metamutt).
