.SH SYNOPSIS

[
.I options

.I newsgroups
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tin
is a full-screen easy to use Netnews reader. It can read news locally
(i.e., \fI/usr/spool/news\fP) or remotely (\fIrtin\fP or \fItin -r\fP option) 
via a NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) server. It will automatically 
utilize nov (news overview) style index files if available locally or via the 
nntp xover command.
.PP
.I
Tin
has four separate levels of operation: Group selection level, Group level, 
Thread level and Article level. Use the 'h' (help) command to view a list of 
the commands available at a particular level.
.PP
On startup \fItin\fP will show a list of the newsgroups found in 
\fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP. An arrow '->' or highlighted bar will point to the first 
newsgroup. Move to a group by using the terminal arrow keys (terminal dependent)
or 'j' and 'k'.  Use PgUp/PgDn (terminal dependent) or Ctrl-U and Ctrl-D to
page up/down.  Enter a newsgroup by pressing RETURN.
.PP
The TAB key advances to the next newsgroup with unread articles and enters it.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.B -a
use ansi color.
.TP
.B -c
create/update index files for every group in \fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP or
file specified by the -f option and mark all articles as read.
.B -C
count articles for each subscribed group at startup. With a large number of
groups this will be slow. However the number of unread articles in each
group will be accurate.
.B -d
delete index files for each group before indexing article (tind index daemon
only).
.TP
.BI -f " file"
use the specified file of subscribed to newsgroups in place of
\fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP.
.TP
.B -h
help listing all command line options.
.TP
.B -H
brief introduction to \fItin\fP that is also shown the first time it is started.
.TP
.BI -I " dir"
directory in which to store newsgroup index files.  Default is 
\fI$HOME/.tin/.news\fP.
.TP
.BI -m " dir"
mailbox directory to use.  Default is \fI$HOME/Mail\fP.
.TP
.BI -M " user"
mail unread articles to specified user for later reading.  For more
information read section Automatic Mailing and Saving New News. 
.TP
.BI -n
Only load groups from the active file that are also subscribed to in the
user's \fI.newsrc\fP.  This allows a noticeable speedup when connecting
via a slow line.
.TP
.BI -q
quick start without checking for new newsgroups.
.TP
.BI -P
purge group index files of articles that no longer exist. Care should
be taken when using this command as it checks each and every article
in each group that is accessed. On a low speed connection this can
have an undesirable effect and it also knocks the hell out of your 
filesystem.
.TP
.B -r
read news remotely from the default NNTP server specified in the
environment variable NNTPSERVER or contained in the file
\fI/etc/nntpserver\fP.
.TP
.B -R
read news saved by the -S option (not yet implemented).
.TP
.BI -s " dir"
save articles to directory.  Default is \fI$HOME/News\fP.
.TP
.B -S
save unread articles for later reading by the -R option.  For more information
read section Automatic Mailing and Saving New News.
.TP
.B -u
create/update index files for every group in \fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP or
file specified by the -f option.  This option is disabled if \fItin\fP 
retrieves its index files via a NNTP server. 
.TP
.B -U
start \fItin\fP in the background to update index files while reading news 
in the foreground.  This option is disabled if \fItin\fP retrieves its index
files via a NNTP server.
.TP
.B -v
verbose mode for -c -M -S -u and -Z options.
.TP
.B -w
quick mode to post an article and then exit.
.TP
.B -z
only start \fItin\fP if there is any new/unread news.  If there is news 
\fItin\fP will position cursor at first group with unread news. Useful 
for putting in login file.
.TP
.B -Z
check if there is any new/unread news and exit with appropriate status.
If -v option is specified the number of unread articles in each group
is printed.  An exit code 0 indicates no news, 1 that an error occurred,
2 that a nntp error occurred and 3 that new/unread news exists.  Useful for 
writing scripts.
.PP
\fITin\fP can also dynamically change its options by the 'M' menu command.
Any changes are written to \fI$HOME/.tin/tinrc\fP.
.PP
The index daemon version, \fItind\fP, supports the -f, -h, -I and -v 
options.
.SH "INDEX FILES"
In order to keep track of threads, \fItin\fP maintains an index for each 
newsgroup. There are a number of methods in which index files can be created 
and updated.
.PP
The simplest method is that each user creates/updates his/her own index files
that are stored in \fI$HOME/.tin/.news\fP. This has the advantage that any 
user can compile and install \fItin\fP, but the disadvantage is that each user 
is going to be creating duplicate files and using precious disk space.  A good 
way to keep index files updated is by doing a \fItin -U\fP that will update 
index files in the background while you are reading news in the foreground. 
You can also update index files via the system batcher cron with the -u
option:
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
30 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/tin -u
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.PP
A slightly better method is to set \fItin\fP setuid news and have all index 
files created and updated in the news spool directory 
(i.e., \fI/usr/spool/news/.news\fP). This has the advantage that there will 
only be one copy of the index files on each machine on your network, but the 
disadvantage is that you will have \fItin\fP running setuid news.
.PP
A better method is to install the \fItind\fP index file updating daemon and 
have it create and update index files for all groups in your active file at
regular intervals in the news spool directory 
(i.e., \fI/usr/spool/news/.news\fP). This has the advantage that there will 
only be one copy of the index files on each machine on your network and 
\fItin\fP must not be setuid news, but the disadvantage is that you will have 
to have news permissions to install \fItind\fP and root permissions to install
an entry in the cron batcher system to have \fItind\fP regularly update index 
files.
.PP
The best method is to install the \fItind\fP index file updating daemon on your
NNTP server and have it create and update index files for all groups in your
active file at regular intervals in the news spool directory 
(i.e., \fI/usr/spool/news/.news\fP).
This has the advantage that there will only be one copy of the index files on
the NNTP server for the whole of your network, but the disadvantage is that you
will have to install my NNTP server patches to allow \fItin\fP to retrieve 
index file from your NNTP server and and you must install an entry in the cron 
batcher system to have \fItind\fP regularly update index files (note that this
is the method we use on our network of 40-50 machines and have not had any 
problems).
.PP
Entering a group the first time tends to be slow because the index file must
be built from scratch unless the \fItind\fP update daemon is being used. To 
alleviate the slowness start \fItin\fP to create all index files for the 
groups you subscribe to with \fItin -u -v\fP and go for a coffee. Subsequent 
readings of a group will cause incremental updating of the index file.
.PP
If reading news remotely and updating index files locally, operation will be
somewhat slower because the articles must be retrieved from the NNTP server.
.SH "NEWS ADMINISTRATION"
Maintaining Netnews on large networks of machines can be a pretty time 
consuming job as I discovered when I was given the job of maintaining our 
news system and news users.
.PP
\fITin\fP is a News User Agent and so most of the users were always asking
questions or doing things that could be frowned upon by their departments.
To relieve news admins (and especially me) some features have been added.
.PP
When a user starts \fItin\fP it is possible to inform them of any important 
changes/information concerning the news system by displaying a message of the 
day (motd) file. The motd file should be created in your news lib directory 
(i.e., \fI/usr/lib/news/motd\fP) and should have file permissions set to 0644. 
The motd file will only be displayed if its contents is newer than the last
time the user started \fItin\fP. If reading news via NNTP my XMOTD patch will
have to have been applied to your NNTP server.
.PP
A user starting \fItin\fP for the first time can be automatically subscribed 
to a list of newsgroups that are deemed appropriate by the news administrator.  
At our site the subscriptions file has 125 groups (our active file contains
over 400 groups with many only being marginally interesting to most people).
The subscriptions file should be created in your news lib directory (i.e.,
\fI/usr/lib/news/subscriptions\fP) and should have file permissions set to 
0644. If reading news via NNTP my LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS patch will have to 
have been applied to your NNTP server.
.PP
If my NNTP XUSER patch has been applied to your NNTP server you will be
able to log the username and machine to your NNTP logfile for usage
statistics.
.SH "SCREEN FORMAT"
\fITin\fP has four separate levels of operation: Group selection level, 
Group level, Thread level and Article level.
.PP
At the Group Selection level the title displays (the name of the newsserver
and) the number of subscribed groups (containing new unread articles).  The
newsgroups are displayed in the middle of the screen with the
number of unread articles displayed on the same line in front.

.PP
At the Group level the title contains the name of the group, the number
of conversation threads and total number of articles i.e., alt.sources (7 23).
If the group has been setup not to thread articles (i.e., alt.sources
is in \fI$(HOME)/.tin/unthread\fP) the title will be alt.sources (U 23).

.SH "FILTERING ARTICLES"
When there is a subject or an author which you are either very
interested in, or find completely uninteresting, you can easily
instruct \fItin\fP to \fIauto-select\fP or \fIauto-kill\fP articles
with specific subjects or from specific authors.  These instructions
are stored in a \fIkill file\fP.
.PP
This menu is accessed by pressing '^K' at the group and page levels.  It
allows the user to kill or select an article that matches the current 
``Subject:'' line, ``From:'' line or a string entered by the user.  
The user entered string can be applied to the ``Subject:'' or ``From:'' 
lines of an article.  The kill description can be limited to the current 
newsgroup or it can apply to all newsgroups. Once entered the user can 
abort the command and not save the kill description, edit the kill file 
or save the kill description.
.PP
On starting \fItin\fP the user's killfile \fI$HOME/.tin/filter\fP is read
and on entering a newsgroup any kill or select descriptions are applied.  
.PP
Articles that match a kill description are marked killed and are not 
displayed. Articles that match an auto-select description are marked 
with a ''*'' when displayed.
.SH "POSTING ARTICLES"
\fITin\fP allows posting of articles, follow-up to already posted articles
and replying direct through mail to the author of an article.
.PP
Use the 'w' command to post an article to a newsgroup.  After entering
the post subject the default editor (i.e., vi) or the editor specified
by the $EDITOR environment variable will be started and the article can
be entered.  To crosspost articles simply add a comma and the name of
the newsgroup(s) to the end of the ``Newsgroups:'' line at the beginning of
the article.  After saving and exiting the editor you are asked if you
wish to a)bort posting the article, e)dit the article again or p)ost
the article to the specified newsgroup(s).
.PP
Use the 'W' command to display a history of the articles you have posted.
The date the article was posted, which newsgroups the article was
posted to and the articles subject line are displayed.
.PP
Use the 'f' / 'F' command to post a follow-up article to an already
posted article.  The 'f' command will copy the text of the original
article into the editor.  The editing procedure is the same as when
posting an article with the 'w' command.
.PP
Use the 'r' / 'R' command to reply direct through mail to the author
of an already posted article.  The 'r' command will copy the text of
the original article into the editor.  The editing procedure is the
same as when posting an article with the 'w' command.  After saving
and exiting the editor you are asked if you wish to a)bort sending
the article, e)dit the article again or s)end the article to the
author.
.SH "CUSTOMIZING THE ARTICLE QUOTE STRING"
When posting a followup to an article or replying direct to the author
of an article via email the text of the article can be quoted. The 
beginning of the quoted text can contain information about the quoted
article (i.e., Name and the Message Id of the article). To allow for
different situations certain information from the article can be used 
in the quoted string. The following variables are expanded if found in 
the tinrc variables 'mail_quote_format=' or 'news_quote_format=':
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'%A  'u +\w'Address'u
\fB%A\fP	Address (Email)
\fB%D\fP	Date

The quoted text section of an article is marked by a preceding quote string
at the beginning of each quoted line. The default quote string is set to 
': ' (a semi-colon followed by a space). The default can be changed by setting
the tinrc variable 'quote_chars=' to ones own preference. A number of other
newsreaders use the '> ' quoting string. To set this one would have to 
write 'quote_chars=>_' (note that '_' underline is used to represent a space).
.SH "MAILING PIPING PRINTING REPOSTING AND SAVING ARTICLES"
The command interface to mail ('m'), pipe ('|'), print ('o'),
repost ('x') and save ('s') articles is the same for ease of use.
.PP
The initial command will ask you to select which a)rticle, t)hread,
h)ot (auto selected) r)egex pattern, t)agged articles you wish to
mail, pipe etc.
.PP
Tagged articles must have already been tagged with the 't' command.
All tagged articles can be untagged by the 'U' untag command.
.PP
If regex pattern matching is selected you are asked to enter a regular
expression (i.e., to match all articles subject lines containing 'net News'
you must enter '*net News*').  Any articles that match the
entered expression will be mailed, piped etc.
.PP
To save articles to a mailbox with the name of the current newsgroup
(i.e., Alt.sources) enter '=' or '=<mailbox name>' when asked for the
save filename.
.PP
To save articles in <newsgroup name>/<filename> format enter '+<filename>'.
.PP
When saving articles you can specify whether the saved files should be
post processed (i.e., unshar shell archive, uudecode multiple parts etc).
A default process type can be set by the 'Process type:' in the 'M'
options menu.
.SH "AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS"
\fITin\fP allows new/unread news articles to be mailed (-M option)/saved
(-S option) in batch mode for later reading.  Useful when going on
holiday and you don't want to return and find that expire has removed a
whole load of unread articles.  Best to run from crontab everyday while away,
after which you will be mailed a report of which articles were mailed/saved
from which newsgroups and the total number of articles mailed/saved.
Articles are saved in a private news structure under your <savedir> directory
(default is \fI$HOME/News\fP).  Be careful of using this option if you read a
lot of groups because you could overflow your file system.  If you only want to
save a few groups it would be best to backup your full \fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP and
create a new one that only contains the newsgroups you want to mail/save.
Saved news can be read later by \fItin -R\fP.
.PP
.TP 2i
\fItin -M iain -c -f newsrc.mail\fP 
(mail any unread articles in newgroups specified in file newsrc.mail)
.PP
.TP 2i
\fItin -S -c -f newsrc.save\fP 
(save any unread articles in newgroups specified in file newsrc.save)
.PP
.TP 2i
\fItin -R\fP 
(read any articles saved by \fItin -S\fP)
.SH SIGNATURES
\fITin\fP will recognize a signature in either \fI$HOME/.signature\fP or
\fI$HOME/.Sig\fP.  If \fI$HOME/.signature\fP exists, then the signature
will be pulled into the editor for mail commands.  A signature in
\fI$HOME/.signature\fP will not be pulled into the editor for posting
commands since \fIinews\fP will append the signature itself.
.PP
A signature in \fI$HOME/.Sig\fP will be pulled into the editor for both
posting and mailing commands.
.PP
The following is an example of a \fI$HOME/.Sig\fP file:

.RE
\fITin\fP also has the capability to generate random signatures on a per
newsgroup basis if so desired. The way to accomplish this is to specify
the default signature or the group attribute sigfile as a directory.
If for example the sigfile path is \fI/usr/iain/.sigs\fP and \fI.sigs\fP is
a directory then \fItin\fP will select a random signature from any file that
is in the directory \fI.sigs\fP (note: one signature per numbered file). A 
random signature can also consist of a fixed part signature that can contain 
your name, address etc. followed by the random sig. The fixed part of the 
random sig is read from the file \fI$HOME/.sigfixed\fP.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBTINRC\fP
Define this variable if you want to specify command line options that \fItin\fP
should be started with to save typing them each time it is started. The
contents of the environment variable are added to the front of the command 
line options before it is parsed therefore allowing an option specified on 
the command line to override the same option specified in the environment.
Note that environment variables that are used to set message header lines
can also be set by adding the header name and value to the
$HOME/.tin/headers file.
.TP
\fBTIN_HOMEDIR\fP
Define this variable if you do not want the .tin directory in 
\fI$HOME/.tin\fP. (i.e., if you want all tin's private files in \fI/tmp/.tin\fP
you would set TIN_HOMEDIR to \fI/tmp\fP.
.TP
\fBTIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR\fP
Define this variable if you do not want the .news directory in 
\fI$HOME/.tin/.news\fP. (i.e., if you want all tin's news index files 
in \fI/tmp/.news\fP you would set TIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR to \fI/tmp\fP.
.TP
\fBTIN_INDEX_MAILDIR\fP
Define this variable if you do not want the .mail directory in 
\fI$HOME/.tin/.mail\fP. (i.e., if you want all tin's mail index files 
in \fI/tmp/.mail\fP you would set TIN_INDEX_MAILDIR to \fI/tmp\fP.
.TP
\fBTIN_INDEX_SAVEDIR\fP
Define this variable if you do not want the .save directory in 
\fI$HOME/.tin/.save\fP. (i.e., if you want all tin's save index files 
in \fI/tmp/.save\fP you would set TIN_INDEX_SAVEDIR to \fI/tmp\fP.
.TP
\fBTIN_LIBDIR\fP
Define this variable if you want to override the LIBDIR path that was compiled
into the tin binary via the Makefile.
.TP
\fBTIN_SPOOLDIR\fP
Define this variable if you want to override the SPOOLDIR path that was 
compiled into the tin binary via the Makefile.
.TP
\fBTIN_NOVROOTDIR\fP
Define this variable if you want to override the NOVROOTDIR path that was 
compiled into the tin binary via the Makefile.
.TP
\fBTIN_ACTIVEFILE\fP
Define this variable if you want to override the LIBDIR/active path that was 
compiled into the tin binary via the Makefile.
.TP
\fBNNTPSERVER\fP
The default NNTP server to remotely read news from.  This variable only
needs to be set if the -r command line option is specified and the file
\fI/etc/nntpserver\fP does not exist.
.TP
\fBNNTPPORT\fP
The NNTP tcp port to read news from.  This variable only
needs to be set if the the tcp port is not the default 119.
.TP
\fBDISTRIBUTION\fP
Set the article header field ``Distribution:'' to the contents of the
variable instead of the system default.
.TP
\fBTEX2ISO\fP
Set the article viewer to decode German style umlaut codes to ISO latin1.
Value 0 has the same effect as not defining the variable. Use in combination
with ISO2ASC.
.TP
\fBISO2ASC\fP
Set the ISO to ASCII charset decoding table character to use in decoding 
an articles text. Values can range from 0 to 6.
.TP
\fBORGANIZATION\fP
Set the article header field ``Organization:'' to the contents of the
variable instead of the system default.  If reading news on an Apollo 
DomainOS machine the environment variable NEWSORG has to be used instead 
of ORGANIZATION.
.TP
\fBREPLYTO\fP
Set the article header field ``Reply-To:'' to the return address specified
by the variable.
This is useful if the machine is not registered in the UUCP mail maps
or if you wish to receive replies at a different machine.
.TP
\fBADD_ADDRESS\fP
This can contain an address to append to the return address when replying
directly through mail to somebody whose mail address is not directly
recognized by the local host.  For example say the return address is
\fIuser@bigvax\fP, but \fIbigvax\fP is not recognized by your host, so
therefore the mail will not reach \fIuser\fP.  But the host \fIlittevax\fP
is known to recognize your host and \fIbigvax\fP, so if ADD_ADDRESS is set
(i.e., 'setenv ADD_ADDRESS @littevax' for csh or 'set ADD_ADDRESS @littevax'
and 'export ADD_ADDRESS' for sh) the address \fIuser@bigvax@littlevax\fP will
be used and the mail will reach \fIuser@bigvax\fP.
This variable has precedence over the file \fI$HOME/.tin/add_address\fP
that may also contain an address.
.TP
\fBBUG_ADDRESS\fP
If the 'R' command bug report mail address is not correct this variable should be
set to the correct mail address.  This variable has precedence over the file
\fI$HOME/.tin/bug_address\fP that may also contain a mail address.
.TP
\fBMAILER\fP
This variable has precedence over the default mailer that is used in all
mailing operations within \fItin\fP (i.e., replying 'rR', and bug reports 'R').
.TP
\fBEDITOR\fP
This variable has precedence over the default editor (i.e., vi) that is
used in all editing operations within \fItin\fP (i.e., posting 'w', replying 'rR',
follow-ups 'fF' and bug reports 'R').
.TP
\fBAUTOSUBSCRIBE\fP
\fItin\fP interprets this variable similarly to rn.  It contains a list of
patterns, separated by commas and possibly prefixed with exclamation points. 
A new group is checked against the list of patterns; if it matches,
\fItin\fP subscribes the user to the group without further query. An
exclamation point negates the meaning of a match on this pattern, and can be
used to cancel certain matches.  For example, setting 
\fIAUTOSUBSCRIBE=comp.os.unix.*,talk.*,!talk.politics.*\fP
will automatically subscribe the user to all new groups in the comp.os.unix
hierarchy, and all talk groups other than talk.politics groups (which will
be queried for as usual.)
.TP
\fBAUTOUNSUBSCRIBE\fP
\fItin\fP interprets this variable similarly to rn.  It is handled like the
\fIAUTOSUBSCRIBE\fP variable, but groups matching the list are unsubscribed
from without further query.  For example, setting 
\fIAUTOUNSUBSCRIBE=alt.flame.*,u*,!uk.*\fP
will automatically unsubscribe the user from all new alt.flame groups 
and all groups starting with u (university groups) other than UK groups (which
will be queried for as usual.)

.SH XTERM BUTTONS
.PP
If the environment variable \fITERM\fP is set to \fIxterm\fP,
then button pressing can be used to select groups and articles.
In this discussion, the buttons are assumed to be assigned conventionally
(i.e., Button1 is the left button).
.PP
In general (i.e., for the group, thread, article and spool menus),
.TP 10
Button1 (left)
enters next (lower) level if you click on a article,
otherwise pages down.
.TP
Button2 (centre)
returns to the previous (upper) level if you click on a article,
otherwise pages up.
.TP
Button3 (right)
positions on the article line under mouse cursor,
or pages down if you've clicked outside the list of articles.
.PP
In the group selection menu, if the mouse is pointing at a group then:
.TP 10
left button
moves to and selects the group pointed at,
just like <CR>.
.TP
centre button
quits the program, just like `q'.
.TP
right button
moves to the group pointed at.
.PP
In the article menu, if the mouse is pointing at an article (or thread) then:
.TP 10
left button
reads the article pointed at, just like <CR>,
or the thread, just like `l'.
.TP
centre button
exits the menu, catching up on the group
if you have `group_catchup_on_exit` set in your configuration,
just like `q'.
.TP
right button
moves to the article (or thread) pointed at.
.PP
In the thread menu, if the mouse is pointing at an article then:
.TP 10
left button
reads article pointed at, just like <CR>.
.TP
centre button
exits the menu, catching up on the thread
if you have `thread_catchup_on_exit` set in your configuration,
just like `q'.
.TP
right button
moves to the article pointed at.
.PP
In the spool selection menu, if the mouse is pointing at a spool selection then:
.TP 10
left button
moves to the spool pointed at.
.TP
other buttons
moves to and selects the spool pointed at.
Just like <CR>.
