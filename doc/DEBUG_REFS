Using the DEBUG_REFS toggle to get threading information
--------------------------------------------------------

This file is of use to people wishing to submit bug reports related to
threading within Tin.
If you are unable to compile/link Tin yourself, this information will be
of no use to you.

If Tin crashes whilst trying to thread, or you think it has incorrectly
threaded a group, then the following instructions will create dump
files which may help identify the problem.

Warning: The output may be large. A big (~2000 article) group can produce
in the order of .5Mb of output. It is much more useful if problems
can be reproduced in groups with as few articles as possible.

1) Recompile Tin with DEBUG_REFS enabled.
   If you have a build tree already, simply editing refs.c to make

   #undef DEBUG_REFS
	read
   #define DEBUG_REFS	1

   and rebuilding will do it.

2) Start Tin as normal

   ./tin

3) If the problem only occurs when entering a group, enter the group in
   question. Make sure the first group you enter is the one causing the
   problem.

4) Quit Tin.

You should now have two files, Refs.info and Refs.dump

Submit these two files with information on what you think the problem is
(if it isn't already obvious), such as:

a) The Subject line of the thread causing the problem
b) Does the problem occur only in certain threading modes

The .overview file from the offending newsgroup would be of great help too.
