# TIN 1.4 - a threaded newsreader
#
# tin.defaults - set some machine specified options
#                and override compile time defaults
#
# Only do changes in this file, if your actual configurations
# differs from the configuration compiled in. All values have
# defaults at compile time, so usually editing this file is not
# needed. An exception are distributed binaries which run on
# different machines, here some configuration might be necessary.

############# global options ####################################

# domainname - this sets a global domain name used in From lines
#
# set your full domain name without a trailing dot
#
#domainname=domain.com

# organization - defines the name of your organization
#

#
#newslibdir=/usr/lib/news

# bugaddress - defines the email address to which users can send
#              bugreports using tin's builtin function
#
# The default points to a developers mailing list located at tin.org.
# You might want to change this address to one of your local
# administration if you want to deal with your lusers problems on
# your own.
#
#bugaddress=tin-bugs@tin.org

# inewsdir - defines the directory containing of the inews executable
#
# Usually tin uses its own builtin inews routines. you might want
# to use an external inews, so you can define the directory where tin
# expects the executable. The program's name is set to inews, don't
# include it
#
#inewsdir=/usr/lib/news

# mm_charset - the default charset to be used in MIME's
#              Content-Type header
#
# luser may change this setting in their tinrcs but it's a good
# idea to set mm_charset here for providing a default
# in most western countries ISO-8859-1 might be the best value
#
#mm_charset=iso-8859-1

# post_mime_encoding
# 
#                                 
# luser may change this setting in their tinrcs but it's a good
# idea to set post_mime_encoding here for providing a default
# in most western countries 8bit might be the best value
#
#post_mime_encoding=8bit

# mail_mime_encoding
# 
#
# luser may change this setting in their tinrcs but it's a good
# idea to set mail_mime_encoding here for providing a default
# as mail isn't guaranteed to be 8bit clean quoted-printable is
# a good choice
#
#mail_mime_encoding=quoted-printable

# disable_gnksa_domain_check - allow unregistered top level domains
#
# you should activate this only if you are using in an intranet environment
# where articles do _not_ leak out into usenet
#
#disable_gnksa_domain_check=OFF

# disable_sender - post without Sender: even if tin normally would add it
#
# use this only if you cannot generate a valid Sender:, eg. if you do not
# have a registered FQDN for your system
#
# disable_sender has no effect if use_builtin_inews is OFF
#
#disable_sender=OFF
