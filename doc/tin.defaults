# TIN 1.4 - a threaded newsreader
#
# tin.defaults - set some machine specified options
#                and override compile time defaults
#
# Only do changes in this file, if your actual configurations
# differs from the configuration compiled in. All values have
# defaults at compile time, so usually editing this file is not
# needed. An exception are distributed binaries which run on
# different machines, here some configuration might be necessary.

# bugaddress - defines the email address to which users can send
#              bugreports using tin's builtin function

# your own.
#
#bugaddress=tin-bugs@tin.org

# inewsdir - defines the directory containing of the inews executable
#
# Usually tin uses its own builtin inews routines. you might want

# include it

#inewsdir=/usr/lib/news

# mm_charset - the default charset to be used in MIME«s
