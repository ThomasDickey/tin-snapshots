NAME
     tin, rtin, tind - A Netnews reader

SYNOPSIS
     tin/rtin/tind [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _n_e_w_s_g_r_o_u_p_s ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_i_n is a full-screen easy to use Netnews reader. It can read
     news locally (i.e. /_u_s_r/_s_p_o_o_l/_n_e_w_s) or remotely (_r_t_i_n or _t_i_n
     -_r option) via a  NNTP  (Network  News  Transport  Protocol)
     server.  It  will  automatically utilize nov (news overview)
     style index files if available locally or via the nntp xover
     command.

     _T_i_n has four separate levels of operation:  Group  selection
     level,  Group level, Thread level and Article level. Use the
     'h' (help) command to view a list of the commands  available
     at a particular level.

     On startup _t_i_n will show a list of the newsgroups  found  in
     $_H_O_M_E/._n_e_w_s_r_c.  An  arrow '->' or highlighted bar will point
     to the first  newsgroup.  Move  to  a  group  by  using  the
     terminal  arrow  keys  (terminal  dependent) or 'j' and 'k'.
     Use PgUp/PgDn (terminal dependent) or Ctrl-U and  Ctrl-D  to
     page up/down.  Enter a newsgroup by pressing RETURN.

     The TAB key advances  to  the  next  newsgroup  with  unread
     articles and enters it.

OPTIONS
     -c          create/update index files  for  every  group  in
                 $_H_O_M_E/._n_e_w_s_r_c or file specified by the -f option
                 and  mark  all  articles  as  read.   -C   count
                 articles  for  each subscribed group at startup.
                 With a large number of groups this will be slow.
                 However  the  number  of unread articles in each
                 group will be accurate.  -d delete  index  files
                 for  each  group  before  indexing article (tind
                 index daemon only).

     -f _f_i_l_e     use  the  specified  file   of   subscribed   to
                 newsgroups in place of $_H_O_M_E/._n_e_w_s_r_c.

     -h          help listing all command line options.

     -H          brief introduction to _t_i_n that is also shown the
                 first time it is started.

     -I _d_i_r      directory in  which  to  store  newsgroup  index
                 files.  Default is $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/._n_e_w_s.

     -m _d_i_r      mailbox   directory   to   use.    Default    is

                 $_H_O_M_E/_M_a_i_l.

     -M _u_s_e_r     mail unread articles to specified user for later
                 reading.   For  more  information  read  section
                 Automatic Mailing and Saving New News.

     -n          Only load groups from the active file  that  are
                 also  subscribed  to in the users ._n_e_w_s_r_c.  This
                 allows a noticeable speedup when connecting  via
                 a slow line.

     -q          quick start without checking for new newsgroups.

     -P          purge group index  files  of  articles  that  no
                 longer  exist.  Care  should be taken when using
                 this command as it checks each and every article
                 in  each  group that is accessed. On a low speed
                 connection this can have an  undesirable  effect
                 and   it  also  knocks  the  hell  out  of  your
                 filesystem.

     -r          read news remotely from the default NNTP  server
                 specified in the environment variable NNTPSERVER
                 or contained in the file /_e_t_c/_n_n_t_p_s_e_r_v_e_r.

     -R          read news  saved  by  the  -S  option  (not  yet
                 implemented).

     -s _d_i_r      save  articles   to   directory.    Default   is
                 $_H_O_M_E/_N_e_w_s.

     -S          save unread articles for later reading by the -R
                 option.    For  more  information  read  section
                 Automatic Mailing and Saving New News.

     -u          create/update index files  for  every  group  in
                 $_H_O_M_E/._n_e_w_s_r_c   or  file  specified  by  the  -f
                 option.   This  option  is   disabled   if   _t_i_n
                 retrieves its index files via a NNTP server.

     -U          start _t_i_n in  the  background  to  update  index
                 files  while  reading  news  in  the foreground.
                 This option is disabled  if  _t_i_n  retrieves  its
                 index files via a NNTP server.

     -v          verbose mode for -c -M -S -u and -Z options.

     -w          quick mode to post an article and then exit.

     -z          only start _t_i_n if there is any new/unread  news.
                 If  there  is  news  _t_i_n will position cursor at
                 first group with unread news. Useful for putting

                 in login file.

     -Z          check if there is any new/unread news  and  exit
                 with   appropriate  status.   If  -v  option  is
                 specified the number of unread articles in  each
                 group  is  printed.  An exit code 0 indicates no
                 news, 1 that an error occurred, 2  that  a  nntp
                 error ocurred and 3 that new/unread news exists.
                 Useful for writing scripts.

     _T_i_n can also dynamically change its options by the 'M'  menu
     command.  Any changes are written to $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/_t_i_n_r_c.

     The index daemon version, _t_i_n_d, supports the -f, -h, -I  and
     -v options.

INDEX FILES
     In order to keep track of threads, _t_i_n  maintains  an  index
     for  each  newsgroup. There are a number of methods in which
     index files can be created and updated.

     The  simplest  method  is  that  each  user  creates/updates
     his/her own index files that are stored in $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/._n_e_w_s.
     This has the advantage that any user can compile and install
     _t_i_n,  but  the disadvantage is that each user is going to be
     creating duplicate files and using precious disk  space.   A
     good  way  to  keep index files updated is by doing a _t_i_n -_U
     that will update index files in the background while you are
     reading  news  in  the foreground. You can also update index
     files via the system batcher cron with the -u option:
          30 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/tin -u

     A slightly better method is to set _t_i_n setuid news and  have
     all  index  files  created  and  updated  in  the news spool
     directory  (i.e.  /_u_s_r/_s_p_o_o_l/_n_e_w_s/._n_e_w_s).   This   has   the
     advantage  that  there  will  only  be one copy of the index
     files on each machine on your network, but the  disadvantage
     is that you will have _t_i_n running setuid news.

     A better method is to install the _t_i_n_d index  file  updating
     daemon  and  have  it  create and update index files for all
     groups in your active file at regular intervals in the  news
     spool  directory  (i.e. /_u_s_r/_s_p_o_o_l/_n_e_w_s/._n_e_w_s). This has the
     advantage that there will only be  one  copy  of  the  index
     files  on  each  machine on your network and _t_i_n must not be
     setuid news, but the disadvantage is that you will  have  to
     have  news  permissions to install _t_i_n_d and root permissions
     to install an entry in the cron batcher system to have  _t_i_n_d
     regularly update index files.

     The best method is to install the _t_i_n_d index  file  updating
     daemon  on  your  NNTP  server and have it create and update

TIN(1)                           LOCAL                            TIN(1)



     index files for all groups in your active  file  at  regular
     intervals    in    the    news    spool    directory   (i.e.
     /_u_s_r/_s_p_o_o_l/_n_e_w_s/._n_e_w_s).  This has the advantage  that  there
     will  only be one copy of the index files on the NNTP server
     for the whole of your network, but the disadvantage is  that
     you will have to install my NNTP server patches to allow _t_i_n
     to retrieve index file from your NNTP  server  and  and  you
     must  install  an  entry  in the cron batcher system to have
     _t_i_n_d regularly update index files (note  that  this  is  the
     method  we use on our network of 40-50 machines and have not
     had any problems).

     Entering a group the first time tends to be slow because the
     index file must be built from scratch unless the _t_i_n_d update
     daemon is being used. To alleviate the slowness start _t_i_n to
     create  all index files for the groups you subscribe to with
     _t_i_n -_u -_v and go for a  coffee.  Subsequent  readings  of  a
     group will cause incremental updating of the index file.

     If reading news remotely and updating index  files  locally,
     operation  will be somewhat slower because the articles must
     be retrieved from the NNTP server.

NEWS ADMINISTRATION
     Maintaining Netnews on large networks of machines can  be  a
     pretty  time  consuming job as I discovered when I was given
     the job of maintaining our news system and news users.

     _T_i_n is a News User Agent and  so  most  of  the  users  were
     always  asking  questions  or  doing  things  that  could be
     frowned upon by their departments.  To relieve  news  admins
     (and especially me) some features have been added.

     When a user starts _t_i_n it is possible to inform them of  any
     important  changes/information concerning the news system by
     displaying a message of the day (motd) file. The  motd  file
     should   be   created  in  your  news  lib  directory  (i.e.
     /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_n_e_w_s/_m_o_t_d) and should have file permissions set  to
     0644.  The  motd file will only be displayed if its contents
     is newer than the last time the user started _t_i_n. If reading
     news  via NNTP my XMOTD patch will have to have been applied
     to your NNTP server.

     A user starting _t_i_n for the first time can be  automatically
     subscribed   to   a  list  of  newsgroups  that  are  deemed
     appropriate by the  news  administrator.  At  our  site  the
     subscriptions  file has 125 groups (our active file contains
     over 400 groups with many only being marginally  interesting
     to  most  people).  The subscriptions file should be created
     in      your      news       lib       directory       (i.e.
     /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_n_e_w_s/_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n_s)    and    should    have   file
     permissions set to 0644. If reading news via  NNTP  my  LIST

     NNTP server.

     If my NNTP XUSER patch has been applied to your NNTP  server
     you  will  be  able  to log the username and machine to your
     NNTP logfile for usage statistics.

SCREEN FORMAT
     _T_i_n has four separate levels of operation:  Group  selection
     level, Group level, Thread level and Article level.

     At the Group Selection level the title displays  the  number
     of  subscribed  groups.  The newsgroups are displayed on the
     left of the  screen  with  the  number  of  unread  articles
     displayed on the same line in the middle of the screen.
               <Selection Num> <Newsgroup> <Num of unread articles>
          i.e.,
               1  alt.sources            10
               2  comp.sources.misc      3
               3  news.software.readers  12

     At the Group level the title contains the name of the group,
     the  number  of  conversation  threads  and  total number of
     articles i.e., alt.sources (7 23).  If the  group  has  been
     setup  not  to  thread  articles  (i.e.,  alt.sources  is in
     $(_H_O_M_E)/._t_i_n/_u_n_t_h_r_e_a_d) the title will be alt.sources (U 23).
     There are two possible display formats as shown below:
               <Selection Num> <Unread> <Responses> <Subject> <Author>
          i.e.,
               1   +   3   Bnews sources?      iain@anl433.uucp
               2       1   This question has   ether@net
          or
               <Selection Num> <Unread> <Responses> <Subject (longer)>
          i.e.,
               1   +   3   Bnews sources?
               2       1   This question has a longer subject line

     At the Article level  the  page  header  has  the  following
     format:
               <Date posted> <Newsgroup>    <Thread 1 of n>
               <Article Num> <Subject>      <Num of responses in thread>
               <Author>                     <Organization>

               <Article body>
          i.e.,
               24 Jul 15:20:03 GMT   alt.sources      Thread 1 of 2
               Article 452           Bnews sources?   3 responses

FILTERING ARTICLES
     When there is a subject or an author which  you  are  either
     very  interested  in,  or find completely uninteresting, you
     can easily instruct _t_i_n to _a_u_t_o-_s_e_l_e_c_t or _a_u_t_o-_k_i_l_l articles
     with  specific  subjects  or  from  specific authors.  These
     instructions are stored in a _k_i_l_l _f_i_l_e.

     This menu is accessed by pressing '^K' at the group and page

     that matches the current ``Subject:'' line,  ``From:''  line
     or a string entered by the user. The user entered string can
     be applied to the ``Subject:''  or  ``From:''  lines  of  an
     article.  The kill description can be limited to the current
     newsgroup or it can apply to all  newsgroups.  Once  entered

     description.

     On starting _t_i_n the users killfile $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/_k_i_l_l  is  read
     and  on entering a newsgroup any kill or select descriptions
     are applied.

     Articles that match a kill description are marked killed and
     are  not  displayed.  Articles  that  match  an  auto-select
     description are marked with a ''*'' when displayed.

POSTING ARTICLES
     _T_i_n allows posting of articles, follow-up to already  posted
     articles  and  replying direct through mail to the author of
     an article.

     Use the 'w' command to  post  an  article  to  a  newsgroup.
     After entering the post subject the default editor (i.e. vi)
     or the editor specified by the $VISUAL environment  variable
     will  be  started  and  the  article  can  be  entered.   To
     crosspost articles simply add a comma and the  name  of  the
     newsgroup(s)  to  the end of the ``Newsgroups:'' line at the
     beginning of the article.   After  saving  and  exiting  the
     editor  you  are  asked  if  you  wish to a)bort posting the
     article, e)dit the article again or p)ost the article to the
     specified newsgroup(s).

     Use the 'W' command to display a history of the articles you
     have  posted.   The  date  the  article  was  posted,  which
     newsgroups the  article  was  posted  to  and  the  articles
     subject line are displayed.

     Use the 'f' / 'F' command to post a follow-up article to  an
     already  posted article.  The 'f' command will copy the text
     of the  original  article  into  the  editor.   The  editing
     procedure  is  the  same as when posting an article with the
     'w' command.

     Use the 'r' / 'R' command to reply direct  through  mail  to
     the  author  of  an already posted article.  The 'r' command
     will copy the text of the original article into the  editor.
     The editing procedure is the same as when posting an article
     with the 'w' command.  After saving and exiting  the  editor
     you  are  asked  if  you wish to a)bort sending the article,
     e)dit the article again or s)end the article to the author.

CUSTOMIZING THE ARTICLE QUOTE STRING
     When posting a followup to an article or replying direct  to
     the  author  of an article via email the text of the article
     can be quoted. The beginning of the quoted text can  contain
     information  about  the  quoted  article (i.e., Name and the
     Message  Id  of  the  article).  To  allow   for   different

     situations  certain information from the article can be used
     in the quoted string. The following variables  are  expanded
     if  found  in  the  tinrc  variables 'mail_quote_format=' or

MAILING PIPING PRINTING REPOSTING AND SAVING ARTICLES
     The command interface  to  mail  ('m'),  pipe  ('|'),  print
     ('o'),  repost ('x') and save ('s') articles is the same for
     ease of use.

     The initial command will ask you to select  which  a)rticle,
     t)hread,   h)ot  (auto  selected)  r)egex  pattern,  t)agged
     articles you wish to mail, pipe etc.

     Tagged articles must have already been tagged with  the  't'
     command.   All  tagged  articles  can be untagged by the 'U'
     untag command.

     If regex pattern matching is selected you are asked to enter
     a  regular  expression  (i.e.  to match all articles subject
     lines containing 'net News' you must  enter  '*net  News*').
     Any  articles  that  match  the  entered  expression will be
     mailed, piped etc.

     To save articles to a mailbox with the name of  the  current
     newsgroup  (i.e. Alt.sources) enter '=' or '=<mailbox name>'
     when asked for the save filename.

     To save articles in <newsgroup name>/<filename> format enter
     '+<filename>'.

     When saving articles you can specify whether the saved files
     should   be  post  processed  (i.e.  unshar  shell  archive,

     set by the 'Process type:' in the 'M' options menu.

AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS
     _T_i_n  allows  new/unread  news  articles  to  be  mailed  (-M
     option)/saved  (-S  option) in batch mode for later reading.
     Useful when going on holiday and you don't  want  to  return
     and  find  that  expire  has  removed a whole load of unread
     articles.  Best to run from  crontab  everyday  while  away,
     after  which  you  will be mailed a report of which articles
     were mailed/saved from which newsgroups and the total number
     of  articles  mailed/saved.  Articles are saved in a private
     news structure under your <savedir>  directory  (default  is
     $_H_O_M_E/_N_e_w_s).   Be careful of using this option if you read a
     lot of groups because you could overflow your  file  system.
     If  you  only  want to save a few groups it would be best to
     backup your full $_H_O_M_E/._n_e_w_s_r_c and create  a  new  one  that
     only  contains  the newsgroups you want to mail/save.  Saved
     news can be read later by _t_i_n -_R.

     _t_i_n -_M _i_a_i_n -_c -_f _n_e_w_s_r_c._m_a_i_l
                         (mail any unread articles  in  newgroups
                         specified in file newsrc.mail)

     _t_i_n -_S -_c -_f _n_e_w_s_r_c._s_a_v_e
                         (save any unread articles  in  newgroups
                         specified in file newsrc.save)

     _t_i_n -_R              (read any articles saved by _t_i_n -_S)

SIGNATURES
     _T_i_n will recognize a signature in either $_H_O_M_E/._s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e or
     $_H_O_M_E/._S_i_g.   If $_H_O_M_E/._s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e exists, then the signature
     will be  pulled  into  the  editor  for  mail  commands.   A
     signature  in  $_H_O_M_E/._s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e  will not be pulled into the
     editor for posting commands  since  _i_n_e_w_s  will  append  the
     signature itself.

     A signature in $_H_O_M_E/._S_i_g will be pulled into the editor for
     both posting and mailing commands.

     The following is an example of a $_H_O_M_E/._S_i_g file:
          NAMES  Iain Lea    iain.lea@scn.de
          SNAIL  Bruecken Str 12, 90419 Nuernberg 90, Germany
          PHONE  +49-911-978-3120 (work)
     _T_i_n also has the capability to generate random signatures on
     a  per  newsgroup basis if so desired. The way to accomplish
     this is to  specify  the  default  signature  or  the  group
     attribute  sigfile  as  a  directory.   If  for  example the
     sigfile path is /_u_s_r/_i_a_i_n/._s_i_g_s and  ._s_i_g_s  is  a  directory
     then  _t_i_n  will select a random signature from any file that
     is in the directory ._s_i_g_s (note: one signature per  numbered

     file).  A  random signature can also consist of a fixed part
     signature that can contain your name, address etc.  followed
     by  the random sig. The fixed part of the random sig is read
     from the file $_H_O_M_E/._s_i_g_f_i_x_e_d.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     TINRC
          Define this variable if you  want  to  specify  command
          line  options  that  _t_i_n should be started with to save
          typing them each time it is started.  The  contents  of
          the  environment variable are added to the front of the
          command line options  before  it  is  parsed  therefore
          allowing  an  option  specified  on the command line to
          override the same option specified in the  environment.
          Note  that  environment  variables that are used to set
          message header lines can also  be  set  by  adding  the
          header name and value to the $HOME/.tin/headers file.

     TIN_HOMEDIR
          Define this variable  if  you  do  not  want  the  .tin
          directory  in  $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n.  (i.e. if you want all tin's
          private files in /_t_m_p/._t_i_n you would set TIN_HOMEDIR to
          /_t_m_p.

     TIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR
          Define this variable if  you  do  not  want  the  .news
          directory  in  $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/._n_e_w_s.  (i.e. if you want all
          tin's news index files  in  /_t_m_p/._n_e_w_s  you  would  set
          TIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR to /_t_m_p.

     TIN_INDEX_MAILDIR
          Define this variable if  you  do  not  want  the  .mail
          directory  in  $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/._m_a_i_l.  (i.e. if you want all
          tin's mail index files  in  /_t_m_p/._m_a_i_l  you  would  set
          TIN_INDEX_MAILDIR to /_t_m_p.

     TIN_INDEX_SAVEDIR
          Define this variable if  you  do  not  want  the  .save
          directory  in  $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/._s_a_v_e.  (i.e. if you want all
          tin's save index files  in  /_t_m_p/._s_a_v_e  you  would  set
          TIN_INDEX_SAVEDIR to /_t_m_p.

     TIN_LIBDIR
          Define this variable if you want to override the LIBDIR
          path  that  was  compiled  into  the tin binary via the
          Makefile.

     TIN_SPOOLDIR
          Define this  variable  if  you  want  to  override  the
          SPOOLDIR path that was compiled into the tin binary via
          the Makefile.

          Define this  variable  if  you  want  to  override  the
          NOVROOTDIR  path  that was compiled into the tin binary
          via the Makefile.

     TIN_ACTIVEFILE
          Define this  variable  if  you  want  to  override  the

          binary via the Makefile.

     NNTPSERVER
          The default NNTP server to  remotely  read  news  from.
          This  variable  only  needs to be set if the -r command
          line option is specified and the  file  /_e_t_c/_n_n_t_p_s_e_r_v_e_r

     NNTPPORT
          The NNTP tcp port to read  news  from.   This  variable
          only  needs  to  be  set if the the tcp port is not the
          default 119.

     DISTRIBUTION
          Set the article header field ``Distribution:''  to  the
          contents of the variable instead of the system default.

     TEX2ISO
          Set the article viewer to decode  german  style  umlaut
          codes  to  ISO  latin1.  Value 0 has the same effect as
          not defining the  variable.  Use  in  combination  with
          ISO2ASC.

     ISO2ASC
          Set the ISO to Ascii charset decoding  table  character
          to  use  in decoding an articles text. Values can range
          from 0 to 6.

     ORGANIZATION
          Set the article header field ``Organization:''  to  the
          contents of the variable instead of the system default.
          If reading news  on  an  Apollo  DomainOS  machine  the
          environment  variable NEWSORG has to be used instead of
          ORGANIZATION.

     REPLYTO
          Set the  article  header  field  ``Reply-To:''  to  the
          return  address  specified  by  the  variable.  This is
          useful if the machine is not  registered  in  the  UUCP

          address when replying directly through mail to somebody
          whose mail address is not directly  recognized  by  the
          local  host.   For  example  say  the return address is
          _u_s_e_r@_b_i_g_v_a_x, but _b_i_g_v_a_x is not recognized by your host,
          so  therefore  the  mail  will not reach _u_s_e_r.  But the
          host _l_i_t_t_e_v_a_x is  known  to  recognize  your  host  and
          _b_i_g_v_a_x,   so   if  ADD_ADDRESS  is  set  (i.e.  'setenv
          ADD_ADDRESS @littevax'  for  csh  or  'set  ADD_ADDRESS
          @littevax' and 'export ADD_ADDRESS' for sh) the address

          reach  _u_s_e_r@_b_i_g_v_a_x.   This variable has precedence over
          the file $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/_a_d_d__a_d_d_r_e_s_s that may  also  contain

     BUG_ADDRESS
          If the 'R' command  bug  report  mail  address  is  not
          correct this variable should be set to the correct mail
          address.  This variable has precedence  over  the  file
          $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/_b_u_g__a_d_d_r_e_s_s  that  may  also  contain a mail
          address.

     MAILER
          This variable has precedence over  the  default  mailer
          that is used in all mailing operations within _t_i_n (i.e.
          replying 'rR', and bug reports 'R').

     VISUAL
          This variable has precedence over  the  default  editor
          (i.e. vi) that is used in all editing operations within
          _t_i_n (i.e. posting 'w', replying 'rR',  follow-ups  'fF'
          and bug reports 'R').

     AUTOSUBSCRIBE
          _t_i_n interprets  this  variable  similarly  to  rn.   It
          contains  a  list  of patterns, separated by commas and
          possibly prefixed with exclamation points. A new  group
          is checked against the list of patterns; if it matches,
          _t_i_n subscribes the user to the  group  without  further
          query.  An  exclamation  point negates the meaning of a
          match on this  pattern,  and  can  be  used  to  cancel
          certain      matches.      For     example,     setting
          _A_U_T_O_S_U_B_S_C_R_I_B_E=_c_o_m_p._o_s._u_n_i_x.*,_t_a_l_k.*,!_t_a_l_k._p_o_l_i_t_i_c_s.*

     keys.  The  left  arrow key goes up a level, the right arrow
     key goes down a level, the up arrow key goes up a line (page

     Many prompts (i.e. 'Mark  everything  as  read?  (y/n):  y')
     within  _t_i_n  offer  a  default  choice  that  the  cursor is
     positioned on.  By pressing <CR> the default value is taken.

     Many prompts (i.e. 'Post subject []>')  within  _t_i_n  can  be
     aborted by pressing ESC.

     When _t_i_n is run in an xterm window  it  will  resize  itself
     each time the xterm is resized.

     _T_i_n will reread the active file at set intervals to show any
     newly arrived news.

XTERM BUTTONS
     If the environment variable  _T_E_R_M  is  set  to  _x_t_e_r_m,  then
     button  pressing  can be used to select groups and articles.
     In this discussion, the buttons are assumed to  be  assigned
     conventionally (i.e., Button1 is the left button).

     In general (i.e., for the group, thread, article  and  spool
     menus),

     Button1 (left)
               enters next  (lower)  level  if  you  click  on  a
               article, otherwise pages down.

     Button2 (centre)
               returns to the previous (upper) level if you click
               on a article, otherwise pages up.

               have    `group_catchup_on_exit`    set   in   your
               configuration, just like `q'.
