Filtering in tin

0. Status

This is an overview of the new filtering capabilities of tin. This
document will be absorbed in the main documentation at some point.


1. Introduction

Tin's filtering mechanism has changed significantly since version 1.3beta.
Originally there were only two possibilities:

1) kill an article matching a rule.
2) hot-select an article matching a rule.

This led to constant confusion, as it seemed important which rule
came first in the filter file, but it wasn't. Then if an article was
selected for whatever reason it couldn't be killed even if it was Craig
Shergold telling you how to make money fast in a crosspost to alt.test.
This binary concept isn't modern anyway, so a much more up-to-date fuzzy
mechanism was necessary: scoring.

When using tin's new scoring mechanism you assign a "score" to each
filter rule. The scores of rules matching the current article are added
and the final score of the article decides if it is regular, marked hot
or killed.

The standard "kill" and standard "select" already in your filter-file have
the score SCORE_KILL and SCORE_SELECT respectively (See section 4). 


2. Changes to the filter-file format

Tin understands the additional "score" command in the filter-file now.

Old style rule:

scope=*
type=0
case=0
subj=*$$$*

New style rule:

group=*
type=0
case=0
score=-100
subj=*$$$*
#####

So you can give the individual rule a weight, based on your opinion
about the rule. e.g. if you want to be sure to never read a certain
individual again, you may give the rule a score of (-)9000. The sign is
not important by now, the direction (+ or -) is still determined by the
"type" of a rule. So the following

group=*
type=0
case=0
score=100
subj=*$$$*
#####

will be equivalent with the rule above for now. When tin writes it's
filter-file the signs are rewritten to match the types. This is intended
for backwards *and* future compatibility. A future version of tin will
delete the "type"-line and write only the score.

If you want only "classical" filtering and don't want to mess around
with score values, you can use the magic words "kill" and "hot" as score
values in your filter file. Example:

group=*
type=0
case=0
score=kill
subj=*$$$*
#####

These are handled as default values at program initialization time and
may be somewhat easier to remember.

You might have noticed by the examples above that tin inserts a line of
hashes between two rules now. This is *not* required, it just improves
readability.


3. Changes in the filter menu

The on screen filter menu is now more compact and fits easily on small
terminals such as a small xterm or a 640x200 CON: window now. It has been
enhanced to allow you to enter a score for the rule you are adding. It should
be in the range from 1 to SCORE_MAX (See section 4) otherwise it will default
to SCORE_DEFAULT (See section 4).


4. Internal defaults

There are some constants defined in tin.h, search for SCORE in your
favorite editor.

SCORE_MAX is the maximum score an article can reach. Any value
above this is cut to SCORE_MAX, the same goes for negative scores.
recommended: 10000

SCORE_DEFAULT is the default score, also used for quick kills and
selects.
recommended: 100

SCORE_KILL is the default score given for any kill rule, if no other
is specified.
recommended: -SCORE_DEFAULT

SCORE_SELECT is the default score for any auto-selection rule, if no
other is specified.
recommended: SCORE_DEFAULT

SCORE_LIM_KILL and SCORE_LIM_SEL are the limits that must be crossed to
mark an article as killed or selected.
WARNING: These will only be used as default in future releases, the
limits will be configurable at runtime.
recommended when used with values given above: -50/+50.


5. Overview of "filter"-commands

Everything here is also described in the file ~/.tin/filter, albeit more
concisely.

All lines are of the form:
command=value

Valid "command"s are:

scope selection:

scope=pattern
group=newsgroup

was the "old" format. It is still understood, when tin reads the
filter-file. The subdivision in local and global filter was removed, so
when tin writes it, it is rewritten to:

group=newsgroup_pattern_list

newsgroup_pattern_list is a comma-separated list of newsgroup_patterns

newsgroup_patterns can be a pattern (wildmat-style) or !pattern,
negating the match of pattern. This is the same format used for the
AUTO(UN)SUBSCRIBE environment variable.

Tin doesn't rework your filter file, the new pattern matching is only
used when you enter new entries by hand.

additional info:

type=num    num: 0=kill, 1=autoselect
case=num    num: 0=casesensitive, 1=caseinsensitive
score=num   num: score value of rule, can now also be one of the magic words
                 "kill" or "hot", which are equivalent to
                 SCORE_KILL and SCORE_SELECT respectively.
time=num    num: time_t value; when rule expires.

matches:            matched to:

subj=pattern        Subject:
from=pattern        From:
msgid=pattern       Message-Id: *AND* full References:
msgid_last=pattern  Message-Id: and last last Reference:s entry only
msgid_only=pattern  Message-Id:
refs_only=pattern   References: line (e.g. <123@ether.net>) without Message-Id:
lines=num           Lines: ; <num matches less than, >num matches more than.
xref=pattern        Xref: ; filter crossposts to groups matching pattern
xref_max=num                } Xref: ; potentially obsolete, collects
xref_score=num,pattern      } scores for crossposting in other
                            } newsgroups

When you are using wildmat pattern-matching, patterns in ~/.tin/filter
should be delimited with "*", verbatim wildcards in patterns must be
escaped with "\". When using the built-in filter-file functions, tin tries
to take care of it for itself, except when you are entering text in the
builtin kill/hot-menu. Then you have to quote manually because tin
doesn't know if e.g. "\[" is already quoted or not.


6. EXAMPLES

6.1 WILDMAT EXAMPLES

none given, too simple, find out yourself ,-)

6.2 REGEXP EXAMPLES

Be sure to change Wildcard setting from WILDMAT (default) to REGEX to make
the following examples to work properly. This can be done using the internal
configuration menu or in file ~/.tin/tinrc

### this kills all articles about CNews, DNEWS or diablo
### in news.software.* but not in news.software.readers
group=news.software.*,!news.software.readers
type=0
case=1
score=kill
subj=([cd]news|diablo)

### this should mark all articles about tin, rtin, tind, ktin or cdtin as hot
group=*
type=1
case=1
score=hot
subj=\b((cd)|[rk]?)?tin(d|pre)?[-\.0-9]*\b

### mark own articles and followups to own articles as hot in all groups
### except local ones
### match From: (a bit complex) and/or
### Message-ID: (I'm the only user who's posting on this server)
group=*,!akk.*,!tin.*
type=1
case=1
score=hot
from=urs@(.*\.)?((akk\.uni-karlsruhe|dana)\.de|(karlsruhe|tin|akk)\.org|ka\.nu|argh\.net)
msgid=@akk3\.akk\.uni-karlsruhe\.de>

### stupid ppl. sometimes read control.cancel to see if there are any
### forged cancels around... the next rule helps you a bit
### ignore know despammers and net.* cancels
group=control.cancel
type=0
case=1
score=kill
from=(news@news\.msfc\.nasa\.gov|clewis@ferret\.ocunix\.on\.ca|jem@xpat\.com|(jeremy|lysander)@exit109\.com|howardk@iswest\.com|cosmo.roadkill.*rauug\.mil\.wi\.us|spamless@pacbell\.net|cwilkins@.*\.clark\.net)
msgid_only=<net-monitor-cancel

### this might help when reading alt.*
### ignore all postings with $$$ or *** or !!!
### ignore all postings shorter then 3 lines
### ignore all postings crossposted into more then 10 groups
group=alt.*,
type=0
case=1
score=-200
subj=[\$\*\!]{3,}
lines=<3
xref_max=10

#####
### mark own articles and direct replies based on message-id
### use 2*hot as score to unkill otherwise killed articles
group=*
type=1
case=1
score=200
msgid_last=doeblitz\.ts\.rz\.tu-bs\.de
#####
### unmark own articles based on message-id
### -> only f'ups to own articles keep marked hot
group=*
type=0
case=1
score=-200
msgid_only=doeblitz\.ts\.rz\.tu-bs\.de


7. TODO

- make the time value in the filter file more human readable.
- convert SCORE_LIM_* to global variables
- rewrite filtering order to get optimal performance
- filtering on arbitrary header lines
- convert .tin/filter, make "type" obsolete, maybe completely new file
  format
- throw out "xref*" when it is obsolete for sure
- maybe autoconf'able values?
