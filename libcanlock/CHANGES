	- Now trying to be compatible with an updated cancel lock draft.
	- We now generate the lock by hashing the Base64 encoding of the
	  cancel key, instead of the underlying binary digest.
	- the xxx_key() and xxx_lock() functions now add the md5: or sha1:
	  tag to the lock.
	- lock_strip_alpha() now discards pesky clue strings and normalizes
	  the case of type codes.
	- the old lock_strip() that returned numeric codes will be going
	  away.

	- Endianness is now automatically figured out by build.

19 Sep 1998
	- Added MD5 hashes.
	- We now accommodate the possibility that strings will be identified
	  by name instead of number, those darned drafts will get you every
	  time.
	- Make changes to the hmac stuff to account for GCC weirdness; some
	  check values were not coming out correctly, but they are now.

	- Initial, just SHA-1.
