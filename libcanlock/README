How to compile it:

	If you are lucky, it will be enough to run the build script. 
	But you may not be that lucky.
     
	As shipped, this library assumes a little-endian 32-bit system
	(i386 family, that is).  You may have to twiddle with
	LITTLE_ENDIAN in sha1.h to make everything work right.  If
	you're not running on a 32-bit system, I don't know what if
	anything you may have to do to get all the little bits in
	order.
	
	Once you've run the build script, check your work by running
	hmactest.  If the expected and actual digests are different,
	your endian-ness or something else is wrong.
	

	After hmactest is giving you the right results, run
	canlocktest.


The canlocktest source code should give you a pretty good idea of how
the functions work.  See the doc directory for relevant RFCs and stuff.
